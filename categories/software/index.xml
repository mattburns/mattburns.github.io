      <description>I keep forgetting how to do this so I’m writing it down in the vain hope I may commit it to memory.
The problem You want to access your locally running dev server on another machine on your local network or maybe even from a virtual machine. whatevs.
The solution Start your dev server with this extra program argument (you can find this under “debug configurations” in eclipse):
--address=0.0.0.0
Now remember it you stupid brain.</description>

      <description>I’m sitting another Sun* Certification exam tomorrow to become a Sun Certified Web Component Developer (SCWCD). I’ve done a bit of revising but I’m writing this post mainly as a way to procrastinate. I should take more exams really if only as a way to get other things done. Procrastination during my final year of uni enabled me to learn how to speedsolve a Rubik’s Cube.
I’ve just read the study guide for the SCWCD exam; Head First Servlets and JSP.</description>

      <description>Do you get an error when you try to install Flex Builder? Ignore it and carry on anyway.
Edit the file:
[eclipse]\links\com.adobe.flexbuilder.feature.core.link
and just stick “path=” at the start so it looks something like this:
path=C:/Program Files/Adobe/Flex Builder 3 Plug-in
Thanks to greylurk for the original tip.</description>

      <title>Convention ÷ Configuration</title>

      <description>I’ve long been sold on the concept of Convention Over Configuration. For me it’s a no-brainer, not only am I lazy, but when I am forced to make a decision about something technical, well, let’s just say the number of times I get it wrong is &amp;gt; 0.
Recently I’ve been playing around with Maven, something I should have done years ago. Maven seems pretty sold on the convention idea too and so I just expected a simple project to work “out of the box”.</description>

      <title>Keep your filling knife clean</title>

      <description>I’m no expert when it comes to DIY. Enthusiastic amateur I’d say.
I fumble my way along, guessing how things should be done, and generally learn the hard way.
I needed to do some more filling today to plug the holes I’d left from my poor skirting board fitting skills.
My filling knife however was caked in gunk after a few years of not being cleaned properly. I kept it clean when I first got it, it was new and I took good care of it.</description>

      <description>It’s 2009! Our digital lives are a breeze and online shopping is just one more option to the newly empowered consumer. Right?
I’m sure I’m not alone in finding the process of buying anything a little tedious now:
 See something in the shop you like Decide not to buy it because you don’t know if that’s a good price You get home and look on the internet Now you have to poke around a few websites and try to work out which is cheapest when you consider postage and tax etc.</description>
