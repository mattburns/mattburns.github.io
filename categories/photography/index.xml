      <description>OK, so you’ve taken an awesome panorama with your iPhone but where do you print it?
OddPrints offers printing at 18&amp;quot;x4&amp;quot; which is the perfect ratio for iPhone photos. Better still it’s only £5.99 !</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I attended a workshop hosted by the talented Lou O’Bedlam. Although I wasn’t fully aware of it at the time, I was getting inspired. Not only was I getting inspired to take more picutres, I was getting inspired to focus on stepping out of my comfort zone and going after my dreams.
Lou talked about recently teaching his nephew how to ask a girl out. His advice was simple: “Just ask her”.</description>

      <description>I get asked the following question quite a lot:
 I want to buy an SLR, what one shall I get?
 In my software engineering life, clients often approach me with a description of software they want me to write. What you really want is for them to describe the problems they are having that need to be solved. That way you might be able to design a better (simpler) solution.</description>
