It’s 6pm on Sunday evening and I am sat at the Vista wifi cafe in Vientiane surrounded by laptops. Virtually every table is staring at one (me included) even whilst eating dinner there are people leaning across their plates typing away. They’re not sat alone either. (I currently am.

Decided to go tubing again today and our mission was to go all the way down the river back to Vang Vieng before 6pm. We started out at 10:30 and met a couple from Holland called Edo and Annalies in the tuk-tuk there who had done trans-mongolian, china, thailand, cambodia, now laos and onto myanmar and thailand.

Tuesday
Back to teaching yesterday and today was jam-packed. Had the same class at the primary school again. This time Mikael another volunteer came and helped me.
Tuesday evening I taught Level 1-1 again on my own this time. Which was fine for a while but soon became rowdy. I played a running game with them where they had to draw pictures on the board and write the word I was saying like Cat, Hat, Fan, etc....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>February 20, 2011&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;4 min&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;karen</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Day 148 to 151 – Tuesday 8th to Friday 11th February – Vang Vieng – Week 2 EEFA English teaching" href=https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/02/20/day-148-to-151-tuesday-8th-to-friday-11th-february-vang-vieng-week-2-eefa-english-teaching/></a></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2>Day 147 – Monday 7th February – Vang Vieng – Karen’s 33rd birthday</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>It’s my birthday and my nan’s.

Early brekkie at the most basic cafe you can imagine with a lovely little family running it. We’d been here a couple of times before as the views are fantastic. The little girl is so cute. She can hardly be 1 year old and likes teetering around in her mum’s high heels. Hired the same moped again for 5 days. I am becoming a pro now :) And headed off to the farm for the 9am meeting....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>February 20, 2011&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;2 min&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;karen</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Day 147 – Monday 7th February – Vang Vieng – Karen’s 33rd birthday" href=https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/02/20/day-147-monday-7th-february-vang-vieng-karens-33rd-birthday/></a></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2>Day 144 to 146 – Friday 4th to Sunday 6th February – Vang Vieng – Karen’s birthday weekend – caves & tubing</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Today changed our opinion of Vang Vieng. We saw a different side to it.
No teaching so we had the whole day to ourselves. After a good-lie in and a chilled out brekkie lounging on raised platforms overlooking the Nam Song river and the karsts beyond, we took the moped for a drive across the countryside. And I mean across it. There aren’t many roads the other side of the river and to get to many of the “sightseeing” places such as caves and viewpoints you need to go across farmland, dodging chickens and cows and rocks and streams....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>February 20, 2011&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;4 min&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;karen</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Day 144 to 146 – Friday 4th to Sunday 6th February – Vang Vieng – Karen’s birthday weekend – caves & tubing" href=https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/02/20/day-144-to-146-friday-4th-to-sunday-6th-february-vang-vieng-karens-birthday-weekend-caves-tubing/></a></article><article class="post-entry tag-entry"><header class=entry-header><h2>Day 140 to 143 – Monday 31st January to Thursday 4th February – Vang Vieng – Week 1 EEFA English Teaching through the Organic Farm</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Before heading to Laos I contacted the EEFA Project.
