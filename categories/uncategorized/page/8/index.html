<h2>Day 300 Sunday 10th July – Magnetic Island & onto Cairns
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Pretty much all of our 300th day was on Magnetic Island. Actually right up til the 21:30 ferry.
Another fabulous sunshiny day, waking up to the sounds of birds and wildlife squawking and ferreting around outside the bungalow. Brekkie in amongst the rainforest (kind of), a couple hours of wifi to finally book our flights from Cairns – we’re skipping Melbourne and off to Sydney as want to spend more time in the sun whilst we can....</p>

<h2>Day 299 Saturday 9th July – Magnetic Island & more Aussie wildlife
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Woke early to the sun shining through the perspex windows and birds chirping & chuckling. There is a wildlife sanctuary in the grounds of our accommodation which offer the opportunity to cuddle a koala. Matt wanted to get a photo of me doing this (and I wasn’t adverse to holding a koala either) so we joined in the tour. We both expected it to be cheesy and for kids. It was both but also now another favourite thing we’ve done on our trip....</p>

<h2>Day 298 Friday 8th July – Magnetic Island
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Greyhound were in our bad books. We dragged ourselves out of bed whilst it was still dark to get the 7am bus so that we could get out of Airlie Beach and to Magnetic Island as soon as possible.
Instead we had to wait in a carpark, watching the sun rise, which admittedly was pretty, for an extra hour and ten minutes.
There was no apology or explanation when it finally arrived....</p>

<h2>Day 297 Thursday 7th July – Airlie Beach
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Airlie Beach is the “jumping off point” (LP says this all the time and I hate it with a passion!) for Whitsunday sailings.
We decided not to bother. They were really expensive and we want to go diving in the Great Barrier Reef from Cairns so we’ll only be staying here a day.
The thing is there isn’t much else here. Well there is. It has a street of restaurants and bars and backpackers and travel agents selling sailing trips and a man-made lagoon because you can’t go in the water because of the crocodiles....</p>

<h2>Day 295 & 296 Tuesday 5th & Wednesday 6th July – Agnes Water/1770
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Tuesday we had our second surf lesson. The water was calmer and the boards were slipperier and we just couldn’t stand up. We are obviously much better in rougher waves. We blame the boards. Still it was fun stuff and we went back on Wednesday for another lesson. This time there were too many people so we just hired our own boards and wetsuits and headed to the beach. We were still pretty terrible but we won’t give up!...</p>

<h2>Day 294 Monday 4th July – Hervey Bay & Agnes Water / Town of 1770
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Our bus wasn’t until 14:25 and the guy at the hostel couldn’t have been nicer. Maybe because we hadn’t been so impressed with his recommendation. We could use all the facilities until we left and he’d give us a lift to the bus station.
So we borrowed the bikes again and yes today is another scorcher. It’s the hottest we’ve felt it in Oz.
And off we cycled in the heat to the 826metre pier and walked to the end passing countless fisherpeople....</p>

<h2>Day 293 Sunday 3rd July – Fraser Island
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Unsure what to make of today.
We were off the magical place of Fraser Island. A top destination for anyone visiting the East Coast of Australia, apparently.
We’d been “sold” the bus trip by the guy at our hostel. We were going to do the 2-day 1-night camping but that was sold out so we were going to do the 1-day jeep but somehow he managed to persuade us the bus would be better....</p>

<h2>Day 292 Saturday 2nd July – Hervey Bay
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>THE SUN IS SHINING!
We have found the sun at last. Proper hot sun. The real skin-crisping kind. MIA since Sihanoukville. Although I guess you could say Siem Reap was hot & sunny but there could be no sunbathing there unless you wanted to look like a KFC family bucket.
Hearing rumours of kangaroos grazing at the north tip of Hervey Bay we borrowed bikes and followed the bike track along the esplanade for 6 or 7km until we reached a sandy bay we couldn’t resist....</p>

<h2>Day 291 Friday 1st July – Noosa National Park, Hervey Bay & Australian wildlife
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Noooo it can’t be 1st July already? That means only 4 weeks left. Better make the most of it then.
Up nice & early with the idea of going for a 3 hour walk through Noosa National Park to spot wild koalas and kookaburras before catching the lunchtime bus to Hervey Bay.
On checking out the girl says “have you seen the koala at the end of the driveway”? And there he was sat calm as anything back to the world clinging onto the high branches on a eucalyptus tree next to the busy roundabout by our hostel....</p>

<h2>Day 290 Thursday 30th June – Noosa – surf lessons
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Learned to surf today! You’d think by now we’d know how to use the internet (dad joke).
Anyhoo the sea was really rough with huge waves and we were both battered and bruised to within an inch of our lives but thoroughly enjoyed it. We even managed to stand on the board a few times. Credit to the surf teacher dude.
We enjoyed it so much we’re going to make sure we can surf again before we leave Oz....</p>
