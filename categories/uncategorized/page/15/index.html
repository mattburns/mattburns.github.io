<h2>Day 232 – Tuesday 3rd May – Christchurch, New Zealand
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Qantas again delivered. Both the Bangkok to Sydney and the Sydney to Christchurch legs were on time and well fed. Had about 6 meals in 12 hours as our clocks turned forward 3 hours then another 2. We’re a total of 11 hours ahead of the UK now so when you’re waking up to eat your cornflakes we’ll be finishing dinner and off to bed.
Look Australia! Arriving at Christchurch airport customs we were scared into throwing our packet of crisps into the bin....</p>

<h2>Day 228 to 231 – Friday 29th April to Monday 2nd May – Siem Reap to Bangkok to New Zealand – surviving Poipet again & Chatuchak weekend market
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>We thought our 10.5hr journey Battambang to Bangkok and 11.5hr trip back from Bangkok to Siem Reap were the norm travel times between Thailand and Cambodia. Not when you have a Michael Schumacher wannabe behind the wheel of the Thai minibus. Our coach left Siem Reap at 8.15 (with Matt sat in the guide’s seat as they seemed to have run out of usual passenger seats by the time we were told it was OK to board) and after 2 pointless stops we were at the border at 11:30....</p>

</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Outside of class we only actually went and did something other than eat & sleep. We went shopping! They have a night market with so many lovely stalls selling souvenirs, clothes and jewellery and a very cool domed bar/restaurant in the centre. Needless to say I re-filled another bag to replace the one Wendy & Steve had kindly taken home for us. And bought a gorgeous silver ring typically on the day that silver was at an all time high so they were reluctant to barter or even sell it to me at one point....</p>

<h2>Day 224 to 227 – Monday 25th to Thursday 28th April – 2nd week teaching at SHAC
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Monday back to school and whilst UK basks in hot sunny weather on a bank holiday we get rain so the cycle there is nice and muddy. It’s a little like being back at home except it’s still roasting.
Aly had some bad news. During the storm on Saturday the lightning had struck everyone’s homes in the area killing everyone’s TVs, her stereo, modem and her husband’s PC. There is a phone mast just next door and so it must have attracted the lightning....</p>

<h2>Day 223 – Sunday 23rd April – Samoeun’s family & party

</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Sunday was party day at Samoeun’s house. He works at Palm Garden Lodge and had invited us a few days ago. He was providing the food and we’d provide the beer.
At 3:30 when Samoeun finished work he took us off in his friend’s tuk-tuk to his home in another village on the outskirts of Siem Reap near West Baray. Stopped off on the way for a couple of crates of beer and a block of ice in a carrier bag....</p>

<h2>Day 222 – Saturday 22nd April – another side to Siem Reap
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Saturday I went off for the morning with Aly to what I thought was advertising her charity in town. But when she said into town she didn’t mean Siem Reap. To her that is the city. A town is a smaller place west of Siem reap on the outskirts called ???? which in English means “Basket”.
So I hopped on the back of her moped and away we went.
She introduced me to some of the families who weave baskets in this area....</p>

<section class=entry-content>
<p>I have been teaching every day from 9:30 to 11:30 and from 15:30 to 17:30 at the shac-smilinghearts school set up by Aly which opened on November 1st 2010. I cycle there and back twice a day. It’s only just over 1km away down mud tracks, past a mixture of large houses and small wooden houses on stilts. Men & boys sit at the side of the polluted streams that run through the village with their fishing rods hoping to catch something....</p>

<h2>Day 209 to 216 – Sunday 10th to Sunday 17th April – Siem Reap
</h2>

<section class=entry-content>
<p>We’re suffering from too much chill-out time, are feeling too de-stressed and need to take a break from the travelling so have come back to Siem Reap for three weeks off to work on stolencamerafinder.
Only when we get here do we remember that the LP describes April in Cambodia as the “killer month”. They weren’t wrong.
Sunday was hot.
Monday was hotter. Blue skies, glaring sunshine. We had our 1st beer after 2 days dry since seeing Wend & Steve in Bangkok....</p>

<h2>Day 208 Saturday 9th April – Bangkok to Siem Reap overland via Poipet (train & bus)
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Never get the train from Bangkok to Aranya Prathet (border).
2 hours on a hard upright seat from Bangkok to Ayuthaya at lunchtime is fine. It’s doable.
6 hours plus half hour delay starting at 6am when you’re knackered because you didn’t sleep properly the night before is uncomfortable to say the least.
The train was relatively empty when we left Hualamphong station. We had a 3-seater for the two of us so nodding off was not a problem....</p>

<h2>Day 206 & 207 – Thursday 7th & Friday 8th April – Bangkok – Wendy & Steve are back
</h2>

<section class=entry-content>
<p>Wendy & Steve are coming back today and they’re staying in Khao San Road. Bugger. Ah well it’s not that far from Silom. Maybe 7km.
We aim to get a boat to KSR to meet them but are running late as usual so head over in a taxi. The traffic is a nightmare. It’s peak-time so takes 50mins. By the time we get there they’re already on their 2nd beer. And it goes downhill from then on really....</p>
