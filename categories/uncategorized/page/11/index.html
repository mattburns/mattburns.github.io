<h2>Day 268 (4400 to to 4580 to 4597km 35/15) Wednesday 8th June – Picton & Marlborough Sound to Wellington, North Island
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>After 5 weeks in the South Island we’re off to the North and the capital of NZ. Right now I’m sat on the Interislander ferry from Picton to Wellington with fabulous views out of the window of Marlborough Sounds. It’s a far better ferry than the ones I remember going on student exchange trips to Germany. I don’t feel seasick for one thing.
Arrived early (for us) in Picton so we could explore Queen Charlotte Drive, the slow winding extremely scenic road with some parts falling into the sea between Picton and Havelock....</p>

<h2>Day 267 (4030km to 4399km 34/16) Tuesday 7th June – back to Christchurch & back to Okiwi Bay, Kaikoura
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Today’s weather: improved, some blue sky. No rain.
Drove around the Banks Peninsula bays of Baron Bay and Okains Bay. Two secluded beaches with not a soul but us. Sometimes this travelling at off-peak really has its benefits. This took us along the tourist drive on the summit of the peninsula so you could really see how this area used to be volcanoes. Again stunning scenery.

<h2>Day 266 (3787km to 4029km 33/17) Monday 6th June – Akaroa
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>It’s a bank holiday in NZ today for the Queen’s birthday.
5.5 aftershock whilst in Timaru. Matt was in the van and felt it shake for 30 seconds. I was in the shower block and felt nothing. Apparently the epicentre was 40km south-west of Christchurch. We’re heading in that direction today. Some damage to buildings and roads reported.
Passed over the longest bridge in New Zealand. Enough said about that. That’s all I can say anyway....</p>

<h2>Day 265 cont… Moeraki boulders
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Almost forgot to say about the Moeraki boulders. How could I forget? A strange phenomenon on a beach in a small place called Moeraki just south of Oamaru. A kind of stop for 5 minutes if you’re passing type of place.
Here’s the obligatory silly photo of Karen, this time with her over-sized white trainers on (the only “sensible” shoes I have on this trip).</p>

<p>Fish & chips by the sea at Oamaru. Our first in NZ. Lip-smackingly tasty freshly battered elephant fish & sole.
Tried to see some more penguins but we had arrived too early in the day and as we needed to gain more ground north continued our road trip to a holiday park in Timaru which was owned by a nice man from Nottingham whom had emigrated here 10 years ago when the exchange rate was NZ$3....</p>

<section class=entry-content>
<p>I am writing two days together as they have events that bleed from one day to the next.
The drive from Kaka Point to Dunedin was non-descript.
Dunedin on the other hand has been colourful to say the least.
There are no holiday parks in the centre so we decided to go for a cheap backpackers called Pennys 5 mins walk from The Octagon (city centre). They had one double room left....</p>

</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Matt invented a game to stop the driving boredom – beep the sheep. Every field of sheep we went past he would slow down and beep his horn. Very irresponsible but pretty funny as all sheep in the vicinity would perk their heads up in fear and then leg it. It doesn’t work as well for cows. They just don’t care enough for beeping and carry on chewing the cud....</p>

<p>The sun is shining today, the blue skies are back. Darn it. Should we have stayed in Milford Sound? But you looked so miserable yesterday MS!

</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>So this is where we camped last night.Our jamminess ran out today. Weather was extremely RUBBISH for going to Milford Sound. Rain & fog are not conducive to picturesque views across sea and mountains. But hey you can’t win ‘em all.
The drive to Milford Sound was pretty spectacular despite the sh*tty weather. You could still get the gist of it and there were definitely Misty Mountains galore.
The most exciting bit of the trip there was the 1km tunnel bored straight through a mountain which was practically pitch black and coming out of the other end into the light you were faced with a sheer drop surrounded by overbearing mountains and an Italian-countryside-Formula-one-esque hairpin road downwards....</p>

</h2>

<section class=entry-content>
<p>Not satisfied with our adrenaline-filled Sunday we went on the Shotover Jet today. A 30min jet-powered speedboat ride through shallow water, down narrow canyons and 360° spins. Pretty exciting but not as good as the bungy. We’re thinking we should have done them the other way around.
Walked, & climbed in part, up to top of hill (Ben Lomond national park) behind Queenstown to see more stunning views.
Took the Gondola back down the hill and reluctantly left Queenstown to drive to a campsite north of Te Anau halfway to Milford Sound....</p>
