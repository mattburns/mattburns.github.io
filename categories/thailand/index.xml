      <description>Never get the train from Bangkok to Aranya Prathet (border).
2 hours on a hard upright seat from Bangkok to Ayuthaya at lunchtime is fine. It’s doable.
6 hours plus half hour delay starting at 6am when you’re knackered because you didn’t sleep properly the night before is uncomfortable to say the least.
The train was relatively empty when we left Hualamphong station. We had a 3-seater for the two of us so nodding off was not a problem.</description>

      <description>Wendy &amp;amp; Steve are coming back today and they’re staying in Khao San Road. Bugger. Ah well it’s not that far from Silom. Maybe 7km.
We aim to get a boat to KSR to meet them but are running late as usual so head over in a taxi. The traffic is a nightmare. It’s peak-time so takes 50mins. By the time we get there they’re already on their 2nd beer. And it goes downhill from then on really.</description>

      <description>Not sure why exactly but we stayed in Bangkok until Wendy came back.
We had wanted to go to the coast but with the weather being so terrible we didn’t want to risk it. And with Matt keen to get on with www.stolencamerafinder.com we pottered about doing not much at all except that.
Wednesday night we tried a kooky restaurant called Cabbages &amp;amp; Condoms in Sukhumvit. It’s a restaurant that gives some of its profits to HIV/AIDS charities.</description>

      <description>Sunday we checked out of Sunflower Place and into Siam Heritage kindly paid for by W &amp;amp; S for our joint birthday pressies. What a place. So swanky. I’m going to sound like a complete child now but it had proper porters take our luggage to the room on one of those brass wheelie things. The bed is huge! The desk has one of those green lamps on it. There are satin dressing gowns and slippers.</description>

      <description>We’re off to meet up with Wend &amp;amp; Steve in Bangkok. Given ourselves a day to get over the border so we get there in time!
Haha of the day: Matt tried to give some not quite so poor woman some money whilst she was just sat waiting for the bus. Much embarrassment.
The Poipet border crossing was quite painless. 20 mins queued up on Cambodia side to get our departure stamp followed by 30mins on the Thai border to be let in.</description>

      <description>After exactly 1 month in Thailand we are now in Laos.
It was pretty simple. We jumped on a rickety old bus from Chiang Rai, our bags piled high at the back of the bus with everyone else’s luggage and our knees up under our chins (well Matt’s anyway) and 2.5 hours later we were dropped off at a tuk-tuk stand in Chiang Khong on the border with Laos. 5 min tuk-tuk ride and we were at the Mekong River and border crossing.</description>

      <description>We went to Myanmar (Burma) today for 2 reasons.
One: we wanted to visit Myanmar (our 6th country so far if you include Nepal :) )
Two: our Thai visa ran out today so we needed to leave the country or pay a fine
It was a surreal and yet dull experience. And far too easy.
10:00 Bus Chiang Rai to Mae Sai (Thai border town)

      <description>The longtail trip down the Mae Nam Kok river (a tributary of the Mae Kong (Mekong) river) was a lovely way of getting to Chiang Rai from the sleepy town of Thaton. It took 3.5 hours including a 20min loo/coffee stop with the most expensive coffee ever. 50THB for half a cup of “Americano”. If we’d gone for Nescafe we would have saved ourselves 30THB per cup! At the pitstop there was also a guy holding a huge great long python saying “photo, photo”.</description>

      <description>Dragged Matt out of bed early so we could make it to the bus station for the 9am bus to Thaton. For some reason everyone we met knew we were heading to Thaton – the tuk tuk driver, the guys at the bus station. Perhaps it’s the only bus that “farang” (foreigners) get from the Chang Pheuak bus station in Chiang Rai.
This was our first ordinary bus journey. A bus with 2 seats one side, 3 seats the other side (similar to before) but with fans and windows that open instead of aircon.</description>

      <description>Congratulations to Helen &amp;amp; Martyn on the birth of their daughter Alys Kate on 13th.
4 months travelling. It feels like we have done so much but nothing at the same time and we’re already a third of the way through. :(
13th – Moved down-market today to MD House in the old city. Partly because we couldn’t justify paying for Butterfly anymore and partly because we wanted to see a bit more of Chiang Mai instead of lazing around by the pool.</description>

      <description>On Christmas Day in Ko Lanta I said Does life get any better than this? The answer is Oh yes! If you stay in the most amazing resort called Butterfly in Chiang Mai.
This was Matt’s main birthday pressie. I was a little concerned because the resort was on the outskirts of Chiang Mai and I was worried we’d be too far away from bars and restaurants for celebrating.
I needn’t have worried.</description>

      <description>Arrived in Sukhothai after a 5.5 hour bus journey. This time 1st class so normal sized seats but included a free lunch stop at a service station. You could choose what you wanted from an array of dishes and Matt &amp;amp; I both chose at random as we had no idea what anything was. The server said “Spicy” in a way that we shouldn’t want it but yes of course we want it.</description>

      <description>From now on Matt doesn’t know where we’re going or staying. It’s kind of a birthday pressie for him. No stress of having to worry about route or accommodation. So I’ve booked the next few days already.
Our first train experience in Thailand from Bangkok to Ayutthaya was pleasant. Although not sleeper trains it reminded us of India with the shutters and open windows and people walking by with baskets of sandwiches, drinks and dried fish.</description>

      <description>Got a taxi to the Siam Square area of Bangkok to go shopping! The place was filled with giant malls, street sellers and small narrow back alleys filled with cute little clothes shops. A shopper’s heaven. I could have spent a fortune.
Spent an extremely long time in MBK mall. The food mall was enormous. You buy coupons from the cashier and then go to one of the 40 food places to get your food.</description>

      <description>Our overnight VIP bus from Krabi to Bangkok had 3 seats per row with lots of room, blankets, free coffee &amp;amp; bun, water and free dinner. Not that we realised all of this until we got on the bus. We’d stuffed ourselves beforehand so a stop with free buffet was a surprise.
Another surprise came at 3am when the onboard hostess tapped me on the head twice to wake me and give me a refreshing towel.</description>

      <description>Beach time is over. Back to the proper mainland and the rest of Thailand.
Our last bit of Railay sightseeing was the Diamond Cave. We’d walked past it every time we’d been anywhere away from Railay Cabana.
On the way to the cave Matt informed me what had been in his towel…a scorpion. Which had crawled on him. Only when he’d knocked it onto the ground had he seen what it was.</description>

      <description>Just about recovered from New Year shenanigans now and we ventured to the 4th and final beach in the Railay area. It is reachable by longtail from West beach, by walking from West beach (we believe) or by walking from Railay East. The pathway from East is right outside Railay Cabana so it was an easy choice to make. Not so easy walk though although it was lovely to walk through the jungle and see more amazing butterflies, we saw the “Tsunami village” where there were a few shells of buildings.</description>

      <description>Bungalows next door are booked up so we’ve resigned ourselves to staying at Railay Cabana for 2 more nights. I am now prepared for cockroaches. And the small green frog in the bathroom was more cute than scary. Although Matt reminded me today to shake towels and clothing before using them in case you come across an unwanted inhabitant. He didn’t tell me what he found in his towel after a shower and I don’t want to know…</description>

      <description>Rock-climbing in Railay is (apologies for americanism here but it needs to be used) awesome. Would definitely recommend it to anyone. I’ve never really climbed outdoors before and it is is completely different to indoors. I managed to do 4.5 climbs and Matt did 6. The weather couldn’t have been better. It was dry but overcast whereas later it rained and since then it’s been sweltering.

      <description>Checked out of bland Harmony House at 10:35 and legged it to the main port of Koh Phi Phi nabbing a ticket on the way to catch the 11am ferry to Krabi and “free transfer” to Ao Nang. Intention was to check out Ao Nang and then go onto Railay. Settled down on a ledge at the back of the ferry alfresco and watched beautiful angelfish darting around the coral attached to the jetty.</description>

      <description>Picked up by a pick up truck to go to Koh Lanta ferry &amp;amp; 90mins later land at Koh Phi Phi. Doesn’t seem to be much accommodation left so we end up at Harmony House the cheapest the touts could find for us. It doesn’t start off well. One girl is checking out because of noise and smells. Another 2 girls want out as guys have been trying to bash their doors down in the night.</description>

      <description>Nice early pickup at 7.15am to get the 8.30am ferry to Ko Phi Phi. The weather was gorgeous and the view of the limestone karsts of Phi Phi appearing in the distance was amazing. Hopped off and hopped onto another ferry to Ko Lanta where a woman was selling ice-creams. Genius idea.
Arrived in Ko Lanta and met off the boat by 2 guys from Fevrier resort who bundled us, another couple and our bags into the back of a pickup truck for the 20min journey to Klong Nin.</description>

      <description>100 days into our adventure and today wasn’t particularly eventful.
In Hat Karon, Phuket and there are “girlie” bars everywhere and lots of middle-aged european men with pretty young Thai ladies on their arm. Or two or three guys sat at a table with one girl.
The beach is lovely, although mostly covered in sunloungers, we found a spot to lay a towel and sunbathed for half an hour before we could bear the heat no longer and went for a wander around the streets full of souvenier shops, clothes shops and restaurants.</description>

      <description>Another mental journey planned by us. Instead of going overland up to Krabi we decided to fly to Phuket from Kuala Lumpur. So we could get the 30-day visa instead of the 15-day visa. (For some reason there is a difference in Thailand depending on whether you enter overland or via an airport???)
Our journey:
7.45am Pink minibus taxi from Telak Nipah to Pangkor Town
8.30am Ferry from Pangkor Town to Lumut</description>
