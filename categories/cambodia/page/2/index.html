<h2>Day 190 – Tuesday 22nd March – Siem Reap
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>After 2 days of temples we are all templed-out. We decide to spend the day doing not much.
So I decide to treat myself to a haircut. My first haircut in 7 months.
I drop by the local hairdressers. Not the one just outside Palm Garden Lodge (there were no customers and since going back in April it has turned into AB Bar with a red strip light and pretty ladyboys so probably wasn’t doing such a good job as a hair salon – this has no reflection on Palm Garden Lodge) but the one just down the road towards town....</p>

<h2>Day 189 – Monday 21st March – Siem Reap – The small circuit
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>5am start to Angkor Wat for sunrise. At that time of the morning Siem Reap is already humming with the sound of tuk-tuks, mopeds and bicycles all heading in one direction.
Making our way along the promenade we were stopped by ticket inspectors with torches before proceeding to join the hoards around the lake at the front of Angkor Wat. We managed to get a good seat on one of the small temples next to the lake and Matt set up his 7D for a timelapse that turned into a time lacks....</p>

<h2>Day 188 – Sunday 20th March – Siem Reap – Angkor, The Big Circuit

<section class=entry-content>
<p>We arrived early on Sunday morning being dropped off in a derelict backstreet yard. It was still dark so we could have been in Timbuktu for all we knew.
Luckily our guys at Palm Garden Lodge were awake and sent Mr. Long to meet us in his tuk tuk. 20 mins later we were snoozing in a lovely comfy room and 3 hours later we were eating noodle soup for breakfast....</p>

<h2>Halfway through! (Monday 14th March)
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>I only went and forgot to say in my blog on 14th March that we’re HALFWAY THROUGH! (well when we were in Phnom Penh we were and I can’t even remember what we did that day. I presume it involved one or two Angkor beers).
Funny how you can spend 10 years thinking about going travelling and here we are 50% done already.
6 months have flown by and from now on we’re on the way back…....</p>

<h2>Day 184 to 187 – Wednesday 16th to Saturday 19th March – Sihanoukville

<section class=entry-content>
<p>What do you do when you’re at the seaside? Go lie on the beach all day of course.
We hadn’t seen the sea since New Year in Thailand and it sounds sad but it was really exciting. Being by the Mekong is lovely but you just can’t beat seeing the sea stretch out to the horizon merging with the blue sky and the sound of waves on the sand. Lush....</p>

<h2>Day 183 – Tuesday 15th March – Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Our bus to Sihanoukville was booked for lunchtime so we thought we’d squeeze in some essential sight-seeing before we left Phnom Penh and visited the Royal Palace & Silver Pagoda first thing Tuesday morning. It took us less than an hour to be unimpressed by it. The Silver Pagoda is famed for its solid silver floor. We expected sparkling, dazzling. We got dull, scratched. Only a small amount was uncovered and “on display”, half of which was held down with masking tape....</p>

<h2>Day 179 to 182 – Friday 11th to Monday 14th March – Phnom Penh
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>I have been particularly slack on the blog writing front so am typing this a month after the event. Therefore it will be dry and sparse as my memory has faded and we have few photos.
From Sen Monorom we went to the capital Phnom Penh, on a normal bus, with one passenger per seat. It took 7 hours, less than we thought, and the journey went surprisingly fast.
By the time we’d settled into our hotel and ventured out it was dark so we couldn’t be bothered to explore too far for food....</p>

<h2>Day 175 to 178 – Monday 7th to Thursday 10th March – Sen Monorom, Mondulkiri province – 3 day elephant & jungle trek
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>If we thought the journey from Stung Treng to Ban Lung was interesting it was nothing compared to the journey to Sen Monorom. How many people can you get in a 13 seater minivan? Well if you attach a luggage rack to the back (boot open), pack everyone’s belongings onto it, tie all the extra random bags full of random stuff around it and pile 4 people on top, 4 adults on each row of seats, 2 adults in the passenger seat and an extra passenger in the driver’s seat plus as many kids as there are gaps…about 26 plus driver....</p>

<h2>Day 174 – Sunday 6th March – Kratie – Irawaddy dolphins

<section class=entry-content>
<p>Kratie was a quiet town. Its main attraction, the rare freshwater Irawaddy dolphins, weren’t easy to spot as they tried their best to keep away from the 15 longtails rumbling around the Mekong close to sunset. However it was nice to see them as they could be extinct soon there are so few left.
Dolphins:And boats:
If you’re quick you may see one or two in these videos:

<h2>Day 172 & 173 – Friday 4th & Saturday 5th March – Ban Lung, Ratanakiri province, Cambodia (Boeng Yeak Lom crater lake)
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Funny minivan journey with 16 adult passengers, 3 babies (one naked, one half-naked from the waist down) and an 8 year old carrying a small plastic bag that chirped. To get to Ban Lung in Ratanakiri province in the north east of Cambodia.
Found another form of paradise again in Tree Top Ecolodge. Very gorgeous wooden bungalows on stilts with all furniture made from reclaimed wood including a very simple but beautiful lamp which had a tree stump for a base and a branch for the stand....</p>
