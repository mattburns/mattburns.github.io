      <description>We thought our 10.5hr journey Battambang to Bangkok and 11.5hr trip back from Bangkok to Siem Reap were the norm travel times between Thailand and Cambodia. Not when you have a Michael Schumacher wannabe behind the wheel of the Thai minibus. Our coach left Siem Reap at 8.15 (with Matt sat in the guide’s seat as they seemed to have run out of usual passenger seats by the time we were told it was OK to board) and after 2 pointless stops we were at the border at 11:30.</description>

      <description>Outside of class we only actually went and did something other than eat &amp;amp; sleep. We went shopping! They have a night market with so many lovely stalls selling souvenirs, clothes and jewellery and a very cool domed bar/restaurant in the centre. Needless to say I re-filled another bag to replace the one Wendy &amp;amp; Steve had kindly taken home for us. And bought a gorgeous silver ring typically on the day that silver was at an all time high so they were reluctant to barter or even sell it to me at one point.</description>

      <description>Monday back to school and whilst UK basks in hot sunny weather on a bank holiday we get rain so the cycle there is nice and muddy. It’s a little like being back at home except it’s still roasting.
Aly had some bad news. During the storm on Saturday the lightning had struck everyone’s homes in the area killing everyone’s TVs, her stereo, modem and her husband’s PC. There is a phone mast just next door and so it must have attracted the lightning.</description>

      <description>Sunday was party day at Samoeun’s house. He works at Palm Garden Lodge and had invited us a few days ago. He was providing the food and we’d provide the beer.
At 3:30 when Samoeun finished work he took us off in his friend’s tuk-tuk to his home in another village on the outskirts of Siem Reap near West Baray. Stopped off on the way for a couple of crates of beer and a block of ice in a carrier bag.</description>

      <description>Saturday I went off for the morning with Aly to what I thought was advertising her charity in town. But when she said into town she didn’t mean Siem Reap. To her that is the city. A town is a smaller place west of Siem reap on the outskirts called ???? which in English means “Basket”.
So I hopped on the back of her moped and away we went.
She introduced me to some of the families who weave baskets in this area.</description>

      <description>I have been teaching every day from 9:30 to 11:30 and from 15:30 to 17:30 at the shac-smilinghearts school set up by Aly which opened on November 1st 2010. I cycle there and back twice a day. It’s only just over 1km away down mud tracks, past a mixture of large houses and small wooden houses on stilts. Men &amp;amp; boys sit at the side of the polluted streams that run through the village with their fishing rods hoping to catch something.</description>

      <description>We’re suffering from too much chill-out time, are feeling too de-stressed and need to take a break from the travelling so have come back to Siem Reap for three weeks off to work on stolencamerafinder.
Only when we get here do we remember that the LP describes April in Cambodia as the “killer month”. They weren’t wrong.
Sunday was hot.
Monday was hotter. Blue skies, glaring sunshine. We had our 1st beer after 2 days dry since seeing Wend &amp;amp; Steve in Bangkok.</description>

      <title>Day 208 Saturday 9th April – Bangkok to Siem Reap overland via Poipet (train &amp; bus)</title>

      <description>Never get the train from Bangkok to Aranya Prathet (border).
2 hours on a hard upright seat from Bangkok to Ayuthaya at lunchtime is fine. It’s doable.
6 hours plus half hour delay starting at 6am when you’re knackered because you didn’t sleep properly the night before is uncomfortable to say the least.
The train was relatively empty when we left Hualamphong station. We had a 3-seater for the two of us so nodding off was not a problem.</description>

      <description>We’re off to meet up with Wend &amp;amp; Steve in Bangkok. Given ourselves a day to get over the border so we get there in time!
Haha of the day: Matt tried to give some not quite so poor woman some money whilst she was just sat waiting for the bus. Much embarrassment.
The Poipet border crossing was quite painless. 20 mins queued up on Cambodia side to get our departure stamp followed by 30mins on the Thai border to be let in.</description>

      <description>Yes I was right. Hangovers from hell. I think we went to sleep about 5am and were up and out in the midday sun packed and waiting for a bus to Battambang. Not pretty.
Luckily the bus journey to Battambang was a bearable 3.5 hours. And trusting a tuk-tuk driver (Mr Bat from Battambang) at the bus stop paid off. The first hotel was full (an LP recommendation) so ended up at its sister hotel Asia Hotel a bit further away but one of the best places we’ve stayed in for comfort and cleanliness and wifi and a steal at $8 a night.</description>

      <description>After 2 days of temples we are all templed-out. We decide to spend the day doing not much.
So I decide to treat myself to a haircut. My first haircut in 7 months.
I drop by the local hairdressers. Not the one just outside Palm Garden Lodge (there were no customers and since going back in April it has turned into AB Bar with a red strip light and pretty ladyboys so probably wasn’t doing such a good job as a hair salon – this has no reflection on Palm Garden Lodge) but the one just down the road towards town.</description>

      <description>5am start to Angkor Wat for sunrise. At that time of the morning Siem Reap is already humming with the sound of tuk-tuks, mopeds and bicycles all heading in one direction.
Making our way along the promenade we were stopped by ticket inspectors with torches before proceeding to join the hoards around the lake at the front of Angkor Wat. We managed to get a good seat on one of the small temples next to the lake and Matt set up his 7D for a timelapse that turned into a time lacks.</description>

      <description>We arrived early on Sunday morning being dropped off in a derelict backstreet yard. It was still dark so we could have been in Timbuktu for all we knew.
Luckily our guys at Palm Garden Lodge were awake and sent Mr. Long to meet us in his tuk tuk. 20 mins later we were snoozing in a lovely comfy room and 3 hours later we were eating noodle soup for breakfast.</description>

      <description>I only went and forgot to say in my blog on 14th March that we’re HALFWAY THROUGH! (well when we were in Phnom Penh we were and I can’t even remember what we did that day. I presume it involved one or two Angkor beers).
Funny how you can spend 10 years thinking about going travelling and here we are 50% done already.
6 months have flown by and from now on we’re on the way back….</description>

      <description>What do you do when you’re at the seaside? Go lie on the beach all day of course.
We hadn’t seen the sea since New Year in Thailand and it sounds sad but it was really exciting. Being by the Mekong is lovely but you just can’t beat seeing the sea stretch out to the horizon merging with the blue sky and the sound of waves on the sand. Lush.</description>

      <description>Our bus to Sihanoukville was booked for lunchtime so we thought we’d squeeze in some essential sight-seeing before we left Phnom Penh and visited the Royal Palace &amp;amp; Silver Pagoda first thing Tuesday morning. It took us less than an hour to be unimpressed by it. The Silver Pagoda is famed for its solid silver floor. We expected sparkling, dazzling. We got dull, scratched. Only a small amount was uncovered and “on display”, half of which was held down with masking tape.</description>

      <description>I have been particularly slack on the blog writing front so am typing this a month after the event. Therefore it will be dry and sparse as my memory has faded and we have few photos.
From Sen Monorom we went to the capital Phnom Penh, on a normal bus, with one passenger per seat. It took 7 hours, less than we thought, and the journey went surprisingly fast.
By the time we’d settled into our hotel and ventured out it was dark so we couldn’t be bothered to explore too far for food.</description>

      <description>If we thought the journey from Stung Treng to Ban Lung was interesting it was nothing compared to the journey to Sen Monorom. How many people can you get in a 13 seater minivan? Well if you attach a luggage rack to the back (boot open), pack everyone’s belongings onto it, tie all the extra random bags full of random stuff around it and pile 4 people on top, 4 adults on each row of seats, 2 adults in the passenger seat and an extra passenger in the driver’s seat plus as many kids as there are gaps…about 26 plus driver.</description>

      <description>Kratie was a quiet town. Its main attraction, the rare freshwater Irawaddy dolphins, weren’t easy to spot as they tried their best to keep away from the 15 longtails rumbling around the Mekong close to sunset. However it was nice to see them as they could be extinct soon there are so few left.
Dolphins:And boats:

If you’re quick you may see one or two in these videos:

      <description>Funny minivan journey with 16 adult passengers, 3 babies (one naked, one half-naked from the waist down) and an 8 year old carrying a small plastic bag that chirped. To get to Ban Lung in Ratanakiri province in the north east of Cambodia.
Found another form of paradise again in Tree Top Ecolodge. Very gorgeous wooden bungalows on stilts with all furniture made from reclaimed wood including a very simple but beautiful lamp which had a tree stump for a base and a branch for the stand.</description>

      <description>After 6 weeks in Laos, we’re now in Cambodia!!
There’s Laos time and there’s snail time. It took us 5 hours to go approx 70km from Don Det to Stung Treng.
8am boat ride from Don Det to the mainland followed by a long wait on a dusty street outside a makeshift travel shop until 10am and we board a bus. Half hour or so later we’re at the Laos/Cambodia border.</description>
