      <description>A taxi took us to our over-priced hotel Cowie’s in Walton Street. We don’t know what that place is trying to be but it’s not getting enough right. And everyone who works there expects tips for nothing. We had 4 of us in a tiny lift plus our backpacks because 2 guys felt the need to help us to our room! Can’t complain about the location though. It’s about 10mins from Gateway of India and Taj Hotel.</description>

      <description>I can’t be bothered to go into the fiasco at Margao Residency. All-in-all we got there at 8am and didn’t get our room until 10am so were pretty pissed off knackered peeps by then. 2hrs probably doesn’t sound that bad but try 2hrs when you have been in a sleeper bus for 10hrs followed by a cafe for 3hours and you’re feeling icky.
Finally found that beaches do exist in Goa :) Got the sardine bus to Benaulim town, walked the 15 mins to the beach, found a beach bar called Rogers and drank beer for 2 hours looking at the sand &amp;amp; sea and the package-holiday beach whales lying on their sunloungers snapping their fingers at waiters to bring them more beers.</description>

      <description>…30 mins after leaving Hospet, we stopped at a service station. All traipsed off to the loo shack where of course only 1 out of the 3 loos was unlocked. I was next in the queue and there was a powercut. Everywhere went pitch black. I didn’t quite think I could bring myself to pee in the dark when you can’t see where you’re putting your feet so trotted back too get the torch (little did I know…see later that night).</description>

      <description>Left Goa at 7.30am and arrived Hospet at 3ish. Somehow it is easy for us now to sit on a train for over 7hrs.
We were in Sleeper class for the first time and we prefer it to 3A/C. Can’t say what it would be like overnight but during the day it was nice to be able to see the outside world passing by. There are windows and shutters but both can be opened as you like to let in air.</description>

      <description>Finally escaped the hospital at 11:00, Matt armed with prescription for more drugs we headed for trusted Margao Residency, our bland business Goa hotel.
Matt didn’t know what to do. Fresh air. No nurses. No stuff being pumped into his arm. Weird concept. He is much better which is good as we don’t want to go back to hospital any time soon – even if it was cheaper than the hotel and had larger rooms.</description>

      <description>Still in hospital but this is definitely the last night and we’re out of here tomorrow morning. Free! Matt is feeling much better &amp;amp; is ecstatic at the thought of leaving. He’s had enough of goop being pumped into his arm and lying down for hours watching TV.
Another trip to the market for veggies and heard Mary’s Boy Child blasting out of someone’s ghetto blaster. Hearing xmas carols makes me a little homesick.</description>

      <description>We have spent most of December so far in hospital. Matt completely lost his appetite and by the time we arrived in Goa he was feeling sick and everything else all over again. We checked into Margao Residency (with hot water!) and both slept for a few hours (neither of us had much sleep on the train). By 5pm he was in such a state I made him see a doctor.</description>

      <description>Today was a weird one. Stayed in Fort Kochin most of the day as our train to Goa wasn’t until 22:30. Braved the post office again to send a couple of parcels. Managed to get it all sewn up neatly and posted in less than 2hrs so not too bad.
Spent a lot of time chilling in Teapot. I am hooked on black tea and Jasmine tea now. Never thought we’d be drinking tea without milk but it tastes good.</description>

      <description>Finally made it to Cherai Beach on Vypeen Island. We’d meant to go last time we were in Kochi but our written-off Sunday put paid to that. Matt was feeling much better too.
The plan was almost scuppered whilst on the way to the ferry. I was feeling a bit queasy so we sat down in the park for a couple of minutes. 2 seconds later a bloke came up to us to try to sell us an eel in a carrier bag – head and tail just poking out the top.</description>

      <description>We have left Alleppey, hooray! Matt is on the mend although not 100% so treated ourselves to a taxi from Alleppey to Fort Cochin. A bit extravagant but more predictable than the train or bus when you’re not feeling too well and we just wanted to move on from here as soon as possible. The taxi driver was very sweet. Mentioning Manchester United and David Beckham but not understanding us when we asked “Do you watch a lot of English football?</description>

      <description>Still in Alleppey. Matt is over the flu symptoms but has Delhi belly all over again. You’re meant to get it in the first 2 weeks of being in India not the last 2 weeks as well.
So decided it was best to stay put for another day as he can’t travel that far and get some antibiotics. We think we have some. Had to check it on wikipedia though ;)</description>

      <description>12:00 We are still in Alleppey. The plan was to leave this morning and go 10km away to stay in the Green Palm Homes on the backwaters to experience life there for real. Unfortunately Matt is too unwell. He was fine last night after dinner but hardly slept and now has flu-like symptoms. So we are having a chill-out day in Alleppey and will decide what to do next when he is feeling a little better.</description>

      <description>Backwater trip today. Before we’d even had breakfast we had our plans sorted. Volker Schmidt, a guy staying at Palmy Residency, asked us if we’d like to join him on a motor boat he’d hired as it was too big for one person. It made sense as we were going to look into doing a boat trip anyway. We have met lots of people with interesting jobs and Volker’s sounded pretty impressive – director &amp;amp; writer (previously actor) in Berlin and Vienna.</description>

      <description>In Alleppey, the backwaters of Kerala, now after a very short train journey by Indian standards of 1hr 45mins at a ridiculously early time of 6:30.
Once again couldn’t sleep as I never can when we have to be up early to catch a plane or train. Matt on the other hand was almost out cold after drifting off whilst reading and smacking himself squarely on the nose with the e-reader.</description>

      <description>Guess who we bumped onto last night? Isla &amp;amp; Neil. It was inevitable as we’ve been in Varkala over a week now. We’re not very good at this “travelling” lark are we. (We blame the railway system!) They’d been here since Sunday and lucky for them had avoided us for 2 days. We have arranged to meet up with them later for dinner. Our last night in Varkala before we head to Alleppey.</description>

      <description>It’s 21st November – Happy Birthday Ali!
Sat on our balcony at Mummy Bamboo House listening to the rain fall steadily through the palm trees onto the dirt tracks below and forming murky orange rivers. The sheets a local lady just hung up on lines between the trees are being thoroughly rinsed again. The taxi Rani’s husband drives is keeping dry under the makeshift tarpaulin garage. The monsoon season is well and truly back.</description>

      <description>Before I forget mum has received the parcel from Darjeeling and it’s in one piece! She thought it looked like drugs as it’s all wrapped in white muslin. It only took 3 weeks so that’s pretty good. I think it has beaten most of the postcards which seem to have been lost in the post.
 Tuesday morning joined the hardened commuters on the 5:50 train from Kochi and by 10:00 we were at Mummy Bamboo House in Varkala about a minute’s walk from the North Cliff edge overlooking the Indian Ocean.</description>

      <description>Saturday morning legged it from Seashore Residency and ended up in Elite Hotel on the main high street which is much much nicer. They had FOUR towels laid out on the bed without us even asking. And plenty of natural light. And no psycho bloke at the desk.
Wandered to Mantancherry on the other side of the island to Fort Cochin where I could have spent an absolute fortune. So many shops selling gorgeous jewellery, pashminas, cushion covers, ornaments you don’t need etc etc.</description>

      <description>Left Chennai at 10:45pm and arrived in Kochi at 11:30am Friday. The atmosphere here is completely different. The station was calm. Not too many people. And we found a Pizza Hut. Very sad but after our experiences of pizza in Havelock we needed it. Went to the Women Changing India photography exhibition in Kochi which Matt had spotted in a photography magazine. It was interesting to see how things are changing here.</description>

      <description>Flight from Port Blair to Chennai was faultless. Kingfisher airlines were excellent. The flight was on time. The bus at Chennai from the plane to the terminal had armchairs &amp;amp; sofas to sit on. I am not kidding. Here I am trying to take a photo of both of us sat in one of the armchairs quickly before anyone sees me and arrests me for breaching airport security. This was embarrassingly the best one out of four attempts!</description>

      <description>Sun is shining yay!
Spent most of Monday on our lovely little bit of secluded beach. Matt in the hammock hiding from the sun and me in as much sun as poss. Had bar-b-q fish again for dinner at Pellicon. This time we had the biggest chunk of tuna fillet I’ve ever seen and a delicious Silverfish marinated in tandoori sauce. Delish.
Tuesday we decided to get up for sunrise. Alarm set for 5am, we dragged ourselves out at 5.</description>

      <description>Happy 1st Anniversary to John &amp;amp; Kelly Wass! Can’t believe it’s been a whole year since your wedding. Time has flown. Miss you guys lots!
Our last day of diving today. It rained all night long heaviest we’d heard and was still raining at 6am when the alarm went off. But by the time we boarded Hammerhead the blue sky was winning and Matt has his first sunburn of the Andaman Islands.</description>

      <description>8am I woke up looked out the window saw blue sky and was like a small child on Christmas morning jumping around over-excitedly. Sunbathing here we come!
I rushed over to order to brekkie whilst Matt dragged himself sleepily out of bed and into the shower. Just as he came out of the hut the black clouds swallowed up the blue and the rains descended.
And it’s rained and rained and rained and rained.</description>

      <description>Happy Anniversary to Steve &amp;amp; Anne-Marie!
It’s bonfire night in the UK and you’d be forgiven for thinking they have the same tradition over here as kids are running round with sparklers and setting off fireworks and the loudest firecrackers I’ve ever heard giving this old woman many mini heart attacks. It’s the Diwali festival of lights today. Such a shame it’s hardly stopped raining. We have been in the hut most of the day.</description>

      <description>For the past week we have been in the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea on the tropical Havelock Island.
We landed in Port Blair on South Andaman Thursday afternoon and jumped in a taxi 15 mins before the last ferry was due to leave for Havelock. We were under no illusion that we’d get that ferry when we landed. But the information desk woman at the airport plus the taxi driver assured us we could make it.</description>

      <description>Kolkata (previously known as Calcutta although may still be known as Calcutta as many people still say they’re from Bombay even though its now Mumbai – must check this out) was a pleasant surprise for a large city.
We arrived late Tuesday night as our train took 2hrs longer than it needed to. Somehow Uli, the German trainee architect who is studying in Vienna, had wangled us a lift to our hotel with a lovely Kolkatan couple whose driver met them at the station in their new Jeep wagon thing that had room for a family of 10 and still had the bubble wrap on the spare wheel.</description>

      <description>Last day in Darjeeling and weather today is lovely. Khangchendzonga is clearly visible on above the skyline. It’s beautiful.
We stopped at our regular egg roll lady and acquired two on the way to Observatory Hill North East of centre to sit and admire the view of the mountain. Not quite as impressive a view as the one from Sandakphu but still not bad.
Stopped for tea tasting where the guy let us smell about 20 different samples of tea which he warmed in his palms first to release the aroma.</description>

      <description>I thought I would try and update the blog as haven’t written for over a week. What better time to do it than whilst Matt has his first shave in 6 weeks. I could be writing a novel here :)
Short version:
The trek was amazing. There were bad points, there always are with us two. But the result at the end was phenomenal. The views at sunrise across the Himalaya mountain range spectacular, breathtaking.</description>

      <description>The sun came out today. Hooray! At 3pm after umming and ahhing and umming some more in our worse than normal indecisive manner, we finally made a decision to go on the trek. At 3.05 as we left the hotel, it started raining. Half hour more of deliberating and we thought sod it lets go. Even if it’s raining its what we have wanted to do the whole time we’ve been in Darjeeling (apart from the toy train of course).</description>

      <description>“A number of rewarding and picturesque treks are accessible from Darjeeling. October and November’s clear skies and warm temperatures make it an ideal time to trek…” says the Lonely Planet.
We wouldn’t know. For the past few days we have wanted to go on the Singalila trek where you can walk to a height of 3600m at Sandakphu and see the top of Everest clearly but the weather is beating us.</description>

      <description>I’ve just found out that Karen’s Nan is being given print-outs of this blog, so a big hello to you from India!
After the first few days I was almost ready to just get on a plane back home again. The people were rude, and the city was filthy.
I’m over that initial culture-shock now (realising it was basically just Delhi) and am now really enjoying India. It’s a mad place, there’s no escaping that, but we’ve met some lovely people and already experienced a lifetime worth of bizarre events.</description>

      <description>Varanasi has been our most surreal experience yet in India. More tuk-tuk touts than you can shake a stick at but a very spiritual and dream-like place.
Paul van der Werf from the train joined us and we made our way to Chaitanya Guest House in Assi Ghat which is the most southerly ghat in Varanasi and was very pleasant. There wasn’t the same amount of hustle and bustle here as in the old city which Varanasi is famous for.</description>

      <description>Day 4 in Delhi
Off to Varanasi today so suddenly thought we ought to do some sightseeing. We chose the Lotus temple and it’s definitely worth seeing. An amazing bit of modern architecture which we think is almost as “wow” as the Taj Mahal. It looks like some kind of futuristic building set amongst green gardens and palm trees. It could be from a sci-fi film. Kind of reminded me of Logan’s run in a way.</description>

      <description>Day 3 in Delhi – coincidences
Things improved today. Although we’re still in HUI. We bumped into two girls Abby and Beth (speech therapists from London) who were also off to see the athletics later. Coincidentally (i’m going to say that alot in these blogs) they were in the same block as us. So we travelled together to the stadium and watched the 100m mens and women’s finals.
The women’s was controversial because there was almost a false start because of the noise the crowd were making.</description>

We pop by Smyle Inn to ask about the room. Yes it will be ready later. Come back at noon. Ok so merrily we go off to get brekkie @ Sam’s Cafe. I won’t even go into that…
Back at 12 and the guy is oh i’m sorry we still have no room. do you mind staying at the other hotel another night? Um yes we do bloody mind mate.</description>

      <description>Our first experience of a sleeper train was pretty good. We’d booked far enough in advance to get the side upper and side lower beds in a 3AC carriage which meant we could sit opposite each other and go to bed whenever we wanted without worrying about anyone else.
It was an 18 hr journey but didn’t feel like it as from 21.30 til 7.30 we were pretty much sleeping. The evening was occupied with reading and interruptions of “chai, chai chai”, “coffee, nescafe, coffee” etc.</description>

      <description>I am writing this in retrospect and cannot believe it’s over a week since we did the camel trek. Time is flying by very fast.
Matt had a couple of days rest plus bought a course of antibiotics from the medical stall in the square for a quid and was ready to do the camel trek. We opted for a 1.5 day trek as we needed to get back by Monday afternoon for our trip to Delhi.</description>

      <description>We arrived in Jaisalmer at 10pm. We left Mt Abu at 8am. 14 bloody hours it took to get here!
The Lonely Planet says there is a direct bus from Mt Abu to Jaisalmer which takes 11 hours. There isn’t.
The Lonely Planet says there are A/C buses available. There aren’t.
We sat on a hot sweaty bus for 7hrs to Jodphur. Bumping up and down and all over the place.</description>

      <description>Firstly Happy Birthday to my dad! Sorry not there to see you. Hope you have a fab day and the card arrives in one piece without Rex chewing it up! x x x
 Mt Abu is unsurprisingly at the top of a mountain and the bus driver was a normal Indian driver – overtaking on bends and liking the edge of the road rather than the safer side. But we got here in one piece to another lake side town.</description>

      <description>Yesterday went for a gorgeous romantic meal at Ambrai restaurant overlooking Lake Pichola, Lake Palace Hotel on Jagniwas Island and City Palace. Beautiful setting. Lush food. Worth every penny. We normally spend around 300 rupees on a meal. That was 1000. Which works out about the same as a Dominos pizza!
Watched Octopussy in a lovely bar lazing on cushions on the floor. We recognised so much of the scenery. it was fun to do it.</description>

So far in Udaipur:-
cows blocking Daiji bridge- squealing chinese tourist!
bathing ghats and old naked washing women
rooftop sunsets
beautiful lake and palaces
good aubergine and tomato curry plus garlic cheese naan @ Jasmine restaurant by the bridge
Quirky Vintage &amp;amp; Classic Car collection with veg thali – personal viewings of the cars including black Rolls Royce rfom Octopussy.</description>

      <description>Today we leave Pushkar to go to Udaipur but it’s a shame to go as we’re loving it here. Even though it is a veggie, alcohol-free place!
It’s a small town with winding streets full of market stalls surrounding a lake and itself surrounded by hills.
Now we have been here a few days people are recognising us so we’re not being hassled so much. Rather just lots of Namastes and they let us move on.</description>

      <description>Matt has promised to add some photos soon to help make this blog more interesting! (he says see flickr :) )
Had enough of the bugs and electricity cuts and dirty walls in Hotel Sanjay so we’ve moved to a quieter part of town to Hotel Rising Star. Only 300 rupees a night (£4.20) and its so much cleaner and lovelier than being on Sadar Bazaar.
No views of the lake but we’re not that far away and in a cluster of other hotels recommended by LP.</description>

      <description>7am wakeup calls from the market traders and motorbikes in the street below didn’t deter us from the first lie-in in a while. Good old ear plugs. 11 o’clock we rolled into the Sadar Bazaar and mooched up the street looking for Laxmi market.
Accosted by Gutar in Navjyoti Tailors he successfully flogged us some new traveller styley clothes so we can start to blend in more. All Matt needs now is a tan and he’d look the part.</description>

      <description>Agra was a relief from Delhi as it wasn’t as hectic but it was very touristy and the tuk tuk drivers were there to get as much as poss out of you.
Except perhaps our last guy Ahmed who arrived at our door at 4am to take us to the train station for our 5.10 train to Ajmer.
This time we chose A/C Chair car so it was like being on a plane, not the comfiest to sleep in but we managed a few hours.</description>

      <description>6am outside Tourists Rest House, no sign of our lift. Not surprised as we weren’t interested in his all day tour of Agra for 600 rupees. We just wanted a lift to the Taj Mahal and play it by ear.
Found another keen soul who nicely ripped us off as he didn’t have any change. Then found out that he’d dropped us off at East Gate and the booking office was 1km away.</description>

      <description>Now in Agra after an epic journey. An hour in a tuk-tuk dodging traffic in Delhi, a manic New Delhi train station which was heaving with people who were sat/sprawled anywhere they could to shade out of the scorcher of a day.
We boarded the train at 13:35 – half an hour before it was scheduled to depart. Sat on a bottom bunk sleeper seat for a scheduled 3hr journey and arrived in Agra at 18:40 with 2 bags of a crisps as sustinence!</description>

      <description>Today is the third day since we arrived in Delhi.
This place is crazy. The roads are chaotic and you assume that there must be crashes every five minutes but somehow, everyone manages to weave in and out of each other as if controlled by some collective brain. Walking around the main parts of Delhi is pretty tiring. Touts constantly approach offering helpful directions to the official tourist office where you can book trains and trips.</description>
