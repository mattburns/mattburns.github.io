      <description>Not much to say here.
Of the 4 autehntication types, “BASIC” uses Base64, in the same way that on a Commodore 64 you’d write BASIC.

      <description>There are 8 Listeners to remember. We know there are attributes in 4 scopes because we know how to Pick the Right Scope Automatically, but you can’t listen to Page attributes, it doesn’t make sense, so that leaves us with RSA; Request, Session and Application. These tally with the objects:
ServletRequest HttpSession ServletContext There is a Listener for each of these objects for lifecycle events, and for attribute events, so that gives us 6 of the Listener Interfaces:</description>

      <title>11 EL Implicit Variables</title>

      <description>All the EL implicit variables are Maps except for pageContext.
To remember the attribute-holding scope objects, just remember to Pick the Right Scope Automatically and stick the word “Scope” on the end:
pageScope requestScope sessionScope applicationScope Then you have 4 param and header objects of the form : (param|header)[Values]
param paramValues header headerValues Then I just remember the last 3:
cookie initParam pageContext (not a Map, it’s the JavaBean) </description>

      <description>This is (a rubbish one) just to help me remember the DD tags:
Whereas Servlet params are “in-it”:</description>

      <description>I’ve made a timelapse film of some daffodils blossoming but I really should do another one of a rose with its stem split into two different bottles of ink.
Not a very interesting post, it’s just another think I need top remember from this book for my exam. Direct a film about PeTaL INk

      <title>Tie up the JSP implicit variables with SCRAPROPE</title>

      <description>Use the acronym SCRAPROPE to remember the JSP implicit variables:
session
config
request
application
pageContext
response
out
page
exception
I should really credit Russ for coming up with the acronym. I think my attempts, SCORP RAPE and SPORE CRAP, weren’t as catchy.</description>

      <description>As I previously metioned, I’m taking the SCWCD exam tomorrow. When trying to cram for any exam I like to make up short poems, acronyms or just random chains of though. For example, I know the difference between Mitosis and Meiosis because Meiosis begins with “Meow” which is what cats do and they have four legs… anyway…
My first thing to remember is that a JspContext has a findAttribute method that I can use to Pick the Right Scope Automatically.</description>
