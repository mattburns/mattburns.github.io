Awoke to a very cool view out the back of the van. Not a bad little campsite location-wise. Shame about the cold showers.
First stop was Whangarei. We weren’t going to bother as we’d heard it wasn’t a very interesting town.

Isla & Neil were excellent tour guides despite the headaches. Took us to Muahai to see the gannet colony, unfortunately this was the only time of the year when there were no gannets. Almost got washed away when an surprise wave covered us.
