<h2>Day 303 to 305 Wednesday 13th to Friday 15th July – Cairns
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>We decided to stay in Cairns for the rest of the week. As much as we want to see Port Douglas and Cape Tribulation we are running short on funds and want to make the most of Sydney & Japan so we have to compromise.
I won’t bore you with the details (as I have in the 302 days previously) so here’s the overview of Cairns post-diving.
Interesting graffiti & sculpture just off Grafton Street near a kooky little cafe called Caffiend....</p>

<h2>Day 302 Tuesday 12th July – diving in Great Barrier Reef
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>It was still dark when the alarm sounded at 5:45. It’s becoming a common occurrence with us, early mornings. Are we old? (We definitely have the crows feet & grey hair these days. It’s hard work all this travelling malarkey.)
But this was for a much better reason than some bus driver waking us up to get a move on. We were off diving!
We had to be at the marina by 7 and by some miracle were up and dressed with cheesy vegemite coated toast in hand we were out the side gate, a swift gallivant through town and down to the boat RedKist on pier E (or finger as they call it here?...</p>

<h2>Day 301 Monday 11th July – Cairns
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>…I was wrong. In Thailand you expect to veer off the road into a tree at any time but at least the seats are suited to overnight travel. The Greyhound buses in Oz are the worst for sleeping on. Their seats are just a little too small to curl up on so you can never get comfy. The aircon was on so it was cold too. And to top it off the onboard loo wasn’t functioning....</p>

<h2>Day 300 Sunday 10th July – Magnetic Island & onto Cairns
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Pretty much all of our 300th day was on Magnetic Island. Actually right up til the 21:30 ferry.
Another fabulous sunshiny day, waking up to the sounds of birds and wildlife squawking and ferreting around outside the bungalow. Brekkie in amongst the rainforest (kind of), a couple hours of wifi to finally book our flights from Cairns – we’re skipping Melbourne and off to Sydney as want to spend more time in the sun whilst we can....</p>

<h2>Day 299 Saturday 9th July – Magnetic Island & more Aussie wildlife
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Woke early to the sun shining through the perspex windows and birds chirping & chuckling. There is a wildlife sanctuary in the grounds of our accommodation which offer the opportunity to cuddle a koala. Matt wanted to get a photo of me doing this (and I wasn’t adverse to holding a koala either) so we joined in the tour. We both expected it to be cheesy and for kids. It was both but also now another favourite thing we’ve done on our trip....</p>

<h2>Day 298 Friday 8th July – Magnetic Island
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Greyhound were in our bad books. We dragged ourselves out of bed whilst it was still dark to get the 7am bus so that we could get out of Airlie Beach and to Magnetic Island as soon as possible.
Instead we had to wait in a carpark, watching the sun rise, which admittedly was pretty, for an extra hour and ten minutes.
There was no apology or explanation when it finally arrived....</p>

<h2>Day 297 Thursday 7th July – Airlie Beach
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Airlie Beach is the “jumping off point” (LP says this all the time and I hate it with a passion!) for Whitsunday sailings.
We decided not to bother. They were really expensive and we want to go diving in the Great Barrier Reef from Cairns so we’ll only be staying here a day.
The thing is there isn’t much else here. Well there is. It has a street of restaurants and bars and backpackers and travel agents selling sailing trips and a man-made lagoon because you can’t go in the water because of the crocodiles....</p>

<h2>Day 295 & 296 Tuesday 5th & Wednesday 6th July – Agnes Water/1770
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Tuesday we had our second surf lesson. The water was calmer and the boards were slipperier and we just couldn’t stand up. We are obviously much better in rougher waves. We blame the boards. Still it was fun stuff and we went back on Wednesday for another lesson. This time there were too many people so we just hired our own boards and wetsuits and headed to the beach. We were still pretty terrible but we won’t give up!...</p>

<h2>Day 294 Monday 4th July – Hervey Bay & Agnes Water / Town of 1770
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Our bus wasn’t until 14:25 and the guy at the hostel couldn’t have been nicer. Maybe because we hadn’t been so impressed with his recommendation. We could use all the facilities until we left and he’d give us a lift to the bus station.
So we borrowed the bikes again and yes today is another scorcher. It’s the hottest we’ve felt it in Oz.
And off we cycled in the heat to the 826metre pier and walked to the end passing countless fisherpeople....</p>

<h2>Day 293 Sunday 3rd July – Fraser Island
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Unsure what to make of today.
We were off the magical place of Fraser Island. A top destination for anyone visiting the East Coast of Australia, apparently.
We’d been “sold” the bus trip by the guy at our hostel. We were going to do the 2-day 1-night camping but that was sold out so we were going to do the 1-day jeep but somehow he managed to persuade us the bus would be better....</p>
