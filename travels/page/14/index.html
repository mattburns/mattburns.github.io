Early brekkie at the most basic cafe you can imagine with a lovely little family running it. We’d been here a couple of times before as the views are fantastic. The little girl is so cute. She can hardly be 1 year old and likes teetering around in her mum’s high heels. Hired the same moped again for 5 days.

No teaching so we had the whole day to ourselves. After a good-lie in and a chilled out brekkie lounging on raised platforms overlooking the Nam Song river and the karsts beyond, we took the moped for a drive across the countryside. And I mean across it. There aren’t many roads the other side of the river and to get to many of the “sightseeing” places such as caves and viewpoints you need to go across farmland, dodging chickens and cows and rocks and streams....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>February 20, 2011&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;karen</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Day 144 to 146 – Friday 4th to Sunday 6th February – Vang Vieng – Karen’s birthday weekend – caves & tubing" href=https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/02/20/day-144-to-146-friday-4th-to-sunday-6th-february-vang-vieng-karens-birthday-weekend-caves-tubing/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2>Day 140 to 143 – Monday 31st January to Thursday 4th February – Vang Vieng – Week 1 EEFA English Teaching through the Organic Farm</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Before heading to Laos I contacted the EEFA Project.
