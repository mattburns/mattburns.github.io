<h2>Day 163 – Wednesday 23rd February – Tha Khaek to Pakse
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Got our backsides in order today and got out of bed and to the bus station in time for the 9am local bus to Pakse. This was the busiest bus we’ve been on so far in Laos. Only 1 mile after starting out there were more people than seats so the plastic stools once again came out and by the time we arrived in Pakse 5 hours later the aisle was full of people sitting on stools (or the floor and leaning on stools trying to sleep) with at least 4 people standing at the front....</p>

<h2>Day 161 & 162 – Monday 21st to Tuesday 22nd February – Savannakhet – Eco-guide Unit homestay & trek
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>It’s now 16:30 on Tuesday and just got back from a 2 day spiritual trek around the local area with a night in a homestay at a local village.
It started at a salt factory about 18km from Savannakhet. The Japanese had drilled for oil and instead found salt water which is pumped out of the ground and either dried in the sun for 2 to 3 days or boiled in big vats....</p>

<h2>Day 160 – Sunday 20th February – Tha Khaek to Savannakhet
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Our bus journey from Tha Khaek was quite an interesting one. They played an array of cheesy music videos. Some young kids prancing around. And one old guy. Well say in his late 50s, singing four or five different songs that all sounded the same and for each video he was wearing a shirt and tie and was either stood at the side of a main road with the limestone cliffs in the background or in a field dancing like your dad....</p>

<h2>Day 158 to 159 – Friday 18th to Saturday 19th February – Tha Khaek
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Tha Khaek is a funny one. There’s not much here but every guesthouse was full on Friday evening. After trying 4 different guesthouses we ended up in the dodgy Khammouane Inter Guest House next door to the Karaoke, with a single bed masquerading as a double bed. I use the word bed in the loosest of terms as the mattress was rock hard and sunken in the middle. There were no curtains on the rails and the wooden shutters were covered by torn mossie nets....</p>

<h2>Day 157 – Thursday 17th February – Vientiane – Admin day
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Had a very constructive day doing admin type stuff.
Picked up our passports from the Immigration office and we are now permitted to stay in Laos until 10th March.
Arranged a way of leaving Vientiane (bus to Tha Khaek tomorrow). As lovely as it is 5 nights is enough when there is so much more of Laos to see. We have been staying at Mixay Paradise Guest House so long now that we were eligible for a free coffee and muffin this afternoon!...</p>

<h2>Day 156 – Wednesday 16th February – Vientiane – Pha That Luang, COPE centre, bowling & Matt gets a haircut
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Hired bikes from the Youth Inn. Very Parisian with their little wicker baskets on the front.
Went back to the Immigration Office to renew our passports. It takes 24hours so we’re in Vientiane for a couple more days.
Most temples and museums are shut between 12:00 & 13:00 so we sat under the Patuxai (Arc de Triomphe) with a beer & a water to shade from the midday sun. Monday & Tuesday were overcast....</p>

<section class=entry-content>
<p>Had a lovely Valentine’s Day in Vientiane. Moved hotels next door to Mixay Paradise Guest House so now we have a cleaner, more modern room with big windows and views over the temple and brekkie included (heart shaped fried-eggs, toast and curry). Although today’s wasn’t too bad as I had American style pancakes with crispy bacon which I thought I was putting maple syrup on but turned out it to be soya sauce....</p>

<h2>Day 153 – Sunday 13th February 2011 – Vientiane capital of Laos
</h2>

<section class=entry-content>
<p>Thought for the day
It’s 6pm on Sunday evening and I am sat at the Vista wifi cafe in Vientiane surrounded by laptops. Virtually every table is staring at one (me included) even whilst eating dinner there are people leaning across their plates typing away. They’re not sat alone either. (I currently am. Matt is off wandering for an hour as it’s our anniversary tomorrow so he’s doing some shopping I assume)....</p>

<section class=entry-content>
<p>Happy birthday Dulcie!
Decided to go tubing again today and our mission was to go all the way down the river back to Vang Vieng before 6pm. We started out at 10:30 and met a couple from Holland called Edo and Annalies in the tuk-tuk there who had done trans-mongolian, china, thailand, cambodia, now laos and onto myanmar and thailand. We arranged to meet for a drink later so they could give us their Cambodia book....</p>

<p>Happy 30th Birthday Lisa & Happy Birthday Leah!
Tuesday
Back to teaching yesterday and today was jam-packed. Had the same class at the primary school again. This time Mikael another volunteer came and helped me.
Tuesday evening I taught Level 1-1 again on my own this time. Which was fine for a while but soon became rowdy. I played a running game with them where they had to draw pictures on the board and write the word I was saying like Cat, Hat, Fan, etc....</p>
