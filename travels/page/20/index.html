<h2>Days 56 to 58 – Monday 8th to Wednesday 10th November – Havelock Island & Port Blair
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Sun is shining yay!
Spent most of Monday on our lovely little bit of secluded beach. Matt in the hammock hiding from the sun and me in as much sun as poss. Had bar-b-q fish again for dinner at Pellicon. This time we had the biggest chunk of tuna fillet I’ve ever seen and a delicious Silverfish marinated in tandoori sauce. Delish.
Tuesday we decided to get up for sunrise. Alarm set for 5am, we dragged ourselves out at 5....</p>

<h2>Day 55 – Sunday 7th November – Havelock Island
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Happy 1st Anniversary to John & Kelly Wass! Can’t believe it’s been a whole year since your wedding. Time has flown. Miss you guys lots!
Our last day of diving today. It rained all night long heaviest we’d heard and was still raining at 6am when the alarm went off. But by the time we boarded Hammerhead the blue sky was winning and Matt has his first sunburn of the Andaman Islands....</p>

<section class=entry-content>
<p>8am I woke up looked out the window saw blue sky and was like a small child on Christmas morning jumping around over-excitedly. Sunbathing here we come!
I rushed over to order to brekkie whilst Matt dragged himself sleepily out of bed and into the shower. Just as he came out of the hut the black clouds swallowed up the blue and the rains descended.
And it’s rained and rained and rained and rained....</p>

<section class=entry-content>
<p>Happy Anniversary to Steve & Anne-Marie!
It’s bonfire night in the UK and you’d be forgiven for thinking they have the same tradition over here as kids are running round with sparklers and setting off fireworks and the loudest firecrackers I’ve ever heard giving this old woman many mini heart attacks. It’s the Diwali festival of lights today. Such a shame it’s hardly stopped raining. We have been in the hut most of the day....</p>

<h2>Days 45 to 52 – Thursday 28th October to Thursday 4th November – Andaman Islands
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>For the past week we have been in the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea on the tropical Havelock Island.
We landed in Port Blair on South Andaman Thursday afternoon and jumped in a taxi 15 mins before the last ferry was due to leave for Havelock. We were under no illusion that we’d get that ferry when we landed. But the information desk woman at the airport plus the taxi driver assured us we could make it....</p>

<h2>Day 44 – Wednesday 27th October – Kolkata
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Kolkata (previously known as Calcutta although may still be known as Calcutta as many people still say they’re from Bombay even though its now Mumbai – must check this out) was a pleasant surprise for a large city.
We arrived late Tuesday night as our train took 2hrs longer than it needed to. Somehow Uli, the German trainee architect who is studying in Vienna, had wangled us a lift to our hotel with a lovely Kolkatan couple whose driver met them at the station in their new Jeep wagon thing that had room for a family of 10 and still had the bubble wrap on the spare wheel....</p>

<h2>Day 42 – Monday 25th October – Darjeeling
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>Last day in Darjeeling and weather today is lovely. Khangchendzonga is clearly visible on above the skyline. It’s beautiful.
We stopped at our regular egg roll lady and acquired two on the way to Observatory Hill North East of centre to sit and admire the view of the mountain. Not quite as impressive a view as the one from Sandakphu but still not bad.
Stopped for tea tasting where the guy let us smell about 20 different samples of tea which he warmed in his palms first to release the aroma....</p>

<h2>Days 37 to 41 – Wednesday 20th to Sunday 24th October (Singalila Ridge Trek)
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>I thought I would try and update the blog as haven’t written for over a week. What better time to do it than whilst Matt has his first shave in 6 weeks. I could be writing a novel here :)
Short version:
The trek was amazing. There were bad points, there always are with us two. But the result at the end was phenomenal. The views at sunrise across the Himalaya mountain range spectacular, breathtaking....</p>

<h2>Day 36 – Tuesday 19th October – Darjeeling
</h2>
</header>
<section class=entry-content>
<p>The sun came out today. Hooray! At 3pm after umming and ahhing and umming some more in our worse than normal indecisive manner, we finally made a decision to go on the trek. At 3.05 as we left the hotel, it started raining. Half hour more of deliberating and we thought sod it lets go. Even if it’s raining its what we have wanted to do the whole time we’ve been in Darjeeling (apart from the toy train of course)....</p>

<p>“A number of rewarding and picturesque treks are accessible from Darjeeling. October and November’s clear skies and warm temperatures make it an ideal time to trek…” says the Lonely Planet.
We wouldn’t know. For the past few days we have wanted to go on the Singalila trek where you can walk to a height of 3600m at Sandakphu and see the top of Everest clearly but the weather is beating us....</p>
