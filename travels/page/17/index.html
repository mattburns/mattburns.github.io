Sam from Jalan Jalan was brilliant in advising us to walk to the bottom of Chinatown instead of the top to catch the local bus to the bus station. I’d read that it could take an hour from the square but it took less than 10 mins from the other end. Fab. We always seem to travel with our backpacks when the sun is hottest and today was particularly muggy and humid inbetween the rain showers....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>January 3, 2011&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;karen</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Day 94 – Thursday 16th December – Melaka to Kuala Lumpur" href=https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/01/03/day-94-thursday-16th-december-melaka-to-kuala-lumpur/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2>Day 92 & 93 – Tuesday 14th to Wednesday 15th December – Melaka, Malaysia</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Tuesday 14th December and we have been travelling for exactly 3 months and we’re now in Malaysia.

Took a lovely luxury bus from Singapore to Melaka. The border crossings were simple. Off the bus at one side of the bridge to exit Singapore and get our passport stamped.

Another partial downside is the temperature. Being so close to the equator it is very hot all day long. Even at midnight it is still very warm. So air-conditioning is everywhere, even outside cooling the streets in some places. A big waste of energy and very environmentally unfriendly.
Visited Chinatown. The cleanest Chinatown I’ve ever been to.

Singapore is completely different to India. It’s kind of been a bit of a “culture-shock” for us and we’re having to adapt to another way of living again.
It is very American-like with huge roads, sky-scrapers and 7-11s everywhere. And it is so very clean (even the money) and organised. Almost futuristic. People in cars stop for you at zebra crossings. It has a great metro system....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>January 3, 2011&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;karen</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Day 89 – Saturday 11th December – Singapore" href=https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/01/03/day-89-saturday-11th-december-singapore/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2>Day 88 – Friday 10th December – Mumbai to Singapore</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Early start today as we’re off on our 2nd leg to Singapore!
Up at 5.30, had a lovely cold shower and no breakfast. Specifically asked the guys in reception last night about breakfast before 6am and they said no problem. We’d also checked when hot water was available – 5am til 12pm (stupid – why have it only switched on in the morning? Don’t people shower in the evenings?)

Finally found that beaches do exist in Goa :) Got the sardine bus to Benaulim town, walked the 15 mins to the beach, found a beach bar called Rogers and drank beer for 2 hours looking at the sand & sea and the package-holiday beach whales lying on their sunloungers snapping their fingers at waiters to bring them more beers....</p></div><footer class=entry-footer>January 3, 2011&nbsp;·&nbsp;2 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;karen</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Day 85 & 86 – Tuesday 7th & Wednesday 8th December – Goa" href=https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/01/03/day-85-86-tuesday-7th-wednesday-8th-december-goa/></a></article><footer class=page-footer><nav class=pagination><a class=prev href=https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/page/16/>« Prev Page</a>
