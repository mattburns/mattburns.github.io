<h2>Day 75 – Saturday 27th November – Alleppey
</h2></header><section class=entry-content>
<p>Still in Alleppey. Matt is over the flu symptoms but has Delhi belly all over again. You’re meant to get it in the first 2 weeks of being in India not the last 2 weeks as well.
So decided it was best to stay put for another day as he can’t travel that far and get some antibiotics. We think we have some. Had to check it on wikipedia though ;)...</p></section><footer class=entry-footer>December 22, 2010&nbsp;·&nbsp;karen</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Day 75 – Saturday 27th November – Alleppey" href=https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/12/22/day-75-saturday-27th-november-alleppey/></a>

<h2>Day 74 – Friday 26th November – Alleppey
</h2></header><section class=entry-content>
<p>12:00 We are still in Alleppey. The plan was to leave this morning and go 10km away to stay in the Green Palm Homes on the backwaters to experience life there for real. Unfortunately Matt is too unwell. He was fine last night after dinner but hardly slept and now has flu-like symptoms. So we are having a chill-out day in Alleppey and will decide what to do next when he is feeling a little better....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer>December 22, 2010&nbsp;·&nbsp;karen</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Day 74 – Friday 26th November – Alleppey" href=https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/12/22/day-74-friday-26th-november-alleppey/></a>

<h2>Day 73 – Thursday 25th November – Alleppey
</h2></header><section class=entry-content>
<p>Backwater trip today. Before we’d even had breakfast we had our plans sorted. Volker Schmidt, a guy staying at Palmy Residency, asked us if we’d like to join him on a motor boat he’d hired as it was too big for one person. It made sense as we were going to look into doing a boat trip anyway. We have met lots of people with interesting jobs and Volker’s sounded pretty impressive – director & writer (previously actor) in Berlin and Vienna....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer>December 22, 2010&nbsp;·&nbsp;karen</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Day 73 – Thursday 25th November – Alleppey" href=https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/12/22/day-73-thursday-25th-november-alleppey/></a>

</h2></header><section class=entry-content>
<p>In Alleppey, the backwaters of Kerala, now after a very short train journey by Indian standards of 1hr 45mins at a ridiculously early time of 6:30.
Once again couldn’t sleep as I never can when we have to be up early to catch a plane or train. Matt on the other hand was almost out cold after drifting off whilst reading and smacking himself squarely on the nose with the e-reader....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer>November 26, 2010&nbsp;·&nbsp;karen</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Day 72 – Wednesday 24th November – Alleppey" href=https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/26/day-72-wednesday-24th-november-alleppey/></a>

</h2></header><section class=entry-content>
<p>Guess who we bumped onto last night? Isla & Neil. It was inevitable as we’ve been in Varkala over a week now. We’re not very good at this “travelling” lark are we. (We blame the railway system!) They’d been here since Sunday and lucky for them had avoided us for 2 days. We have arranged to meet up with them later for dinner. Our last night in Varkala before we head to Alleppey....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer>November 26, 2010&nbsp;·&nbsp;karen</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Day 70 to 71 – Monday 22nd to Tuesday 23rd November – Varkala, Kerala" href=https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/26/day-70-to-71-monday-22nd-to-tuesday-23rd-november-varkala-kerala/></a>

<p>It’s 21st November – Happy Birthday Ali!
Sat on our balcony at Mummy Bamboo House listening to the rain fall steadily through the palm trees onto the dirt tracks below and forming murky orange rivers. The sheets a local lady just hung up on lines between the trees are being thoroughly rinsed again. The taxi Rani’s husband drives is keeping dry under the makeshift tarpaulin garage. The monsoon season is well and truly back....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer>November 26, 2010&nbsp;·&nbsp;karen</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Days 66 to 69 – Thursday 18th to Sunday 21st November – Varkala, Kerala" href=https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/26/days-66-to-69-thursday-18th-to-sunday-21st-november-varkala-kerala/></a>

<p>Before I forget mum has received the parcel from Darjeeling and it’s in one piece! She thought it looked like drugs as it’s all wrapped in white muslin. It only took 3 weeks so that’s pretty good. I think it has beaten most of the postcards which seem to have been lost in the post.
 Tuesday morning joined the hardened commuters on the 5:50 train from Kochi and by 10:00 we were at Mummy Bamboo House in Varkala about a minute’s walk from the North Cliff edge overlooking the Indian Ocean....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer>November 26, 2010&nbsp;·&nbsp;karen</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Days 64 to 65 – Tuesday 16th to Wednesday 17th November – Varkala, Kerala" href=https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/26/days-64-to-65-tuesday-16th-to-wednesday-17th-november-varkala-kerala/></a>

<p>Saturday morning legged it from Seashore Residency and ended up in Elite Hotel on the main high street which is much much nicer. They had FOUR towels laid out on the bed without us even asking. And plenty of natural light. And no psycho bloke at the desk.
Wandered to Mantancherry on the other side of the island to Fort Cochin where I could have spent an absolute fortune. So many shops selling gorgeous jewellery, pashminas, cushion covers, ornaments you don’t need etc etc....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer>November 23, 2010&nbsp;·&nbsp;karen</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Days 61 to 63 – Saturday 13th to Monday 15th November – Fort Cochin, Kerala" href=https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/23/days-61-to-63-saturday-13th-to-monday-15th-november-fort-cochin-kerala/></a>

<h2>Day 60 – Friday 12th November – Kochi to Fort Cochin, Kerala

<p>Left Chennai at 10:45pm and arrived in Kochi at 11:30am Friday. The atmosphere here is completely different. The station was calm. Not too many people. And we found a Pizza Hut. Very sad but after our experiences of pizza in Havelock we needed it. Went to the Women Changing India photography exhibition in Kochi which Matt had spotted in a photography magazine. It was interesting to see how things are changing here....</p></section><footer class=entry-footer>November 23, 2010&nbsp;·&nbsp;karen</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Day 60 – Friday 12th November – Kochi to Fort Cochin, Kerala" href=https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/23/day-60-friday-12th-november-kochi-to-fort-cochin-kerala/></a>

<h2>Day 59 – Thursday 11th November – Port Blair to Chennai to Kochi
</h2></header><section class=entry-content>
<p>Flight from Port Blair to Chennai was faultless. Kingfisher airlines were excellent. The flight was on time. The bus at Chennai from the plane to the terminal had armchairs & sofas to sit on. I am not kidding. Here I am trying to take a photo of both of us sat in one of the armchairs quickly before anyone sees me and arrests me for breaching airport security. This was embarrassingly the best one out of four attempts!...</p></section><footer class=entry-footer>November 18, 2010&nbsp;·&nbsp;karen</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Day 59 – Thursday 11th November – Port Blair to Chennai to Kochi" href=https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/18/day-59-thursday-11th-november-port-blair-to-chennai-to-kochi/></a>
