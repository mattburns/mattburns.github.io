No-one answered. It was hot \u0026 humid \u0026 after a long journey we craved a shower. We gave them 10 more minutes and still no answer so had to go for Plan B. J Hoppers hostel. Luckily just around the corner and luckily they had a double room in Japanese style. So we almost got what we were hoping for.\nWe took a wander to get our bearings and found a great little bakery which provided us with good snackettes to eat whilst soaking up some sun in the nearest park. The park happened to be the peace memorial park. The main area impacted by the A-bomb dropped at the end of the Second World War. It is a moving place. Lots of green space as you would imagine from a park with different memorials dotted about.\nIt is surrounded by water and when we walked to the other side we saw the infamous building that was at the epicentre [_cough – Ed_] of the bomb. The A-bomb dome building (originally known as the Hiroshima Prefectural Commercial Exhibition Hall). I’ve seen photographs and pictures of that building many times but seeing it in reality is indescribable. I couldn’t believe we were standing looking at it.\nThe A-domeChildren’s Peace Monument\nThe girl in the monument, Sadako, believed that if she made 1,000 paper cranes she would cure her leukaemia. She died before she had finished so children all over the world, inspired by her story, build cranes and send them to the memorial in many different forms. It is very moving to see.\n\n\nPeace memorial with the names of the all of the victims inside.\nIn the evening after a roof-top beer went on the hunt for the famous Hiroshima speciality dish Okonomiyaki. You sit in front of a giant hot plate watching the chefs fry up batter with bacon and cabbage, served over noodles and smothered in a gooey sauce served in what looks like a deep-pan pizza tray with a trowel. Sounds like a leftover fry-up, looks like a left-over fry-up, tastes like a left-over fry-up. Delicious.\n\n Footnote: Japan Rail Pass information\nFor those of you thinking about going to Japan and wondering about the trains, do it. You MUST apply for a Japan Rail Pass before entering the country as it is only available to non-Japanese visitors or Japanese non-residents. You receive an exchange note which you take to one of the main train stations to, unsurprisingly, exchange for a rail pass. This comes as a folded piece of card with your name and reference. It isn’t very technically advanced and if you lose it you’re stuffed. You cannot get a replacement.\nThere are lots of companies that can order this for you. I believe STA Travel do it. But as we were strapped for time we used an online agency called Japanese Experience based in Paris who were excellent and sent it to our hotel in Tokyo. It cost ¥28000 for one ticket plus £17 delivery charge. This may sound like a lot. It isn’t. A single journey from Tokyo to Hiroshima costs something like ¥18000.\nWe exchanged our note for the Japan Rail Pass at Ueno station. It took about 10 mins as you need to complete a form and wait for them to issue the pass.\nLots more info can be found at Seat61.com.\n","wordCount":"829","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2011-10-11T20:17:00Z","dateModified":"2011-10-11T20:17:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"karen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/10/12/day-311-thursday-21st-july-hiroshima/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Matt Burns","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mattburns.co.uk/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
