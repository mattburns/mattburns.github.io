Today was the latter.\nStill determined to do everything we planned we set off to catch a bus to the temples in north-western Kyoto. Little did we know that a) there were no bus stops for half a mile \u0026 b) we’d have to wait in the searing sun for 20mins for a bus \u0026 c) we’d get on the wrong bus \u0026 d) it would take 40mins to get to the nearest point to the temples. However we managed to get a day ticket, jump off at the right place to get another bus to the temple.\nIt took a little longer again as we stood in what we thought was a queue for the second bus only for it to turn up, everyone get on and it to leave without us. How could that possibly happen you may ponder? Turns out the elderly guy in front of us was just waiting and waiting and as he didn’t get on the bus neither did we. Oh how we laughed!\nFinally a bus came that took us in the right direction and 10 mins later we were at the university, the nearest stop. Turns out it’s at least another 10 min walk to the temple. I am so glad that it was a Zen temple. We needed the power of Zen to relax and calm us after that epic journey.\nAnd was it worth the trip? Well this one, the Ryoan-ji temple was not as impressive as we had hoped. The gardens were pretty and the wildlife were cool – orange spotted coy carp and herons. The Zen garden inside the temple was bizarre. A peaceful garden of 15 rocks surrounded by white gravel. The belief is that whatever direction you look at it from you can never see all 15 without reaching “enlightenment”. We thought we could see all 15 so perhaps we became enlightened quickly.\nDidn’t feel so enlightened when we got told off for going through the wrong door into the temple. We’d walked the wrong way around the grounds without realising which meant we encountered the groups door first. So when we returned to pick up our shoes they were no longer where we’d left them. Instead they were on full display in the naughty corner. How disgraceful were we not giving in our ticket we’d paid a ridiculous amount for at the gate. The stroppy lady on the counter put a bit of a dampener on the experience of visiting a Zen temple and made us feel like it was purely there for the tourist income rather than the spiritual purpose it undoubtedly had been built for 6 centuries ago. Such a shame as 99% of the people we’ve met so far have been lovely.\nNext stop was Kinkaku-ji temple, a much more impressive structure, completely covered in gold leaf which reflected \u0026 glimmered in the surrounding lake. This photo does not do it justice.\n The gardens were lovely to walk around too and we wish we’d had more time to wander.\nBy some miracle we managed to get the right bus which took us directly to Kyoto station. This meant we could get on the next train to Osaka and we arrived before 15:00 when the parade was due to start.\nWe were starving but all we could find was a Starbucks so our lame budget afforded us a large coffee to share. We looked like freaks. The whole place was packed with people drinking iced coffee and there we were with our steaming latte, in the middle of Japanese summer.\nWe headed through the streets of Osaka to find the festival parade route. One thing that fascinated us about Japanese cities was the amount of businesses that could be squeezed into one building. You would often see a sign outside a 6 storey building with 15 different logos. This one had to be a record though surely.\nThis wasn’t part of the parade. It was just a white van that passed us and I liked it.\nWe found a shaded spot on a bridge under a flyover that seemed a good place to pitch ourselves to watch the procession.\nIt was 15:30 by now and there were teeny hints of a parade with a couple of police here and there.\nAs we stood sweltering in the humidity we eyed up the fans that many passers-by were holding wishing I’d brought my Miyajima fan with us. It seemed odd that so many people had similar looking fans I thought I’d go off and investigate.\nI finally found her and Matt was gutted he’d not offered to go himself when he saw the photo she was happy for me to take of her. 😀\nFinally at 16:15 there were signs the Osaka Tenjin Matsuri festival had begun.\nAnd I’m not denying we didn’t think why did we come all this way when the only guys to walk by for 15 mins were looking bored, sweaty \u0026 having a smoke…\nWe moved position to a kerb by the river and things looked up… Funny guy on horseback, check. Traditional shopping trolley, check.\nThen more \u0026 more interesting characters filled the street.\nAnd that was the parade over and done with. Next were the boats, but that couldn’t be done on an empty stomach. We pushed the boat out (ahem) with a pot of edamame, a hot dog \u0026 two beers from a riverside bar before settling on a great grassy spot at the end of the island in the middle of Yodo river to watch the boat procession. Every person that had been in the parade had piled into the barges ready for a trip down the river. Hundreds and hundreds of people covered at least 20 boats, some sitting quietly, others eating, drinking and partying.\nThe finale of the festival is a big fireworks display which we had a cat’s chance in hell getting anywhere near. The main bridges were either closed or heaving with people. We wandered aimlessly along roads trying to get closer and the best view we could find was from behind the train tracks. Matt got some great shots of whizzing trains \u0026 overhead planes.\nAll in all a very pleasant day and we even managed to get back to Kyoto the same evening.\n","wordCount":"1147","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2011-10-28T14:45:00Z","dateModified":"2011-10-28T14:45:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"karen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/10/28/day-315-monday-25th-july-kyoto-osaka-ryoan-ji-kinkaku-ji-temples-tenjin-matsuri-festival/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Matt Burns","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mattburns.co.uk/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
