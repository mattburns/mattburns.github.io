Either way it’s manually scraped and shovelled into baskets by 40 Lao families who work there. The salt is then sent to local areas or Vietnam. It was unbelievable how manual the work is. Things which in the UK we’d automatically think a machine would do but this is providing work for local people.\nPasert our ECO guide on a pile of salt (pretending it’s snow):Sun-drying the saltBoiling the salt water:Kids playing at the salt factoryThe trek began with meeting a local guide at the roadside and then diving straight into the forest. He was there to explain the multitude of plants, trees and creatures which had a variety of uses for the local people.\nWe drank water from some chopped branches, tried fresh cardomon, different fruits – some looked like dung, others like cherries, some sweet and some sharp, leaves that tasted like sour apple which are eaten to wake you up, other leaves that helped bad stomachs, others that helped with dizziness. An ant that when crushed made you dizzy from the smell and the same ant would act as an anti-venom if a snake bit you.\nHe showed us a tree which they collect glue from and another tree which when burned releases an oil which is used for burning torches. The locals set fire to the trunk and after 10mins put out the fire with a bundle of branches. The tree then releases the oil. They come back every 5 days to collect the oil.\nNatural tree oilHoney is collected from these super-high trees. Wooden pegs are driven into the bark by 3 knocks only. The guy will then climb up the pegs and hammer in more as he goes until he gets to the top. No harness is used. They don’t fall because they receive agreement from the tree spirit that they can go up for honey beforehand and they are protected from falling by this spirit.\n Inspiring environmental signs were all over the forest. I particularly liked this one:Lunch was a feast. Served sat next to Nam Thong lake (?). Liver, pork, fish, boiled eggs, small eggplants, bamboo concoction wrapped in banana leaf, green beans, stem broccoli, sticky rice, bananas, rice cakes covered with locally grown sugar palm caramel and corn in coconut milk \u0026 rice.\nOn reaching the local village we passed the fishing lake filled with men and women with mini chinese nets dipping in and out of the water. Pasert showed us a bamboo cage which had three fish trapped inside, one a catfish.\nOur bed for the night – Mr Nhang’s HomestayOur hostess Mrs Nhang who fed us warm sweet sticky rice with banana and beans wrapped in banana leaf as soon as we arrived.\nThe oldest stupa in Laos (over 2000 years old) is situated in the grounds of the local templeVillagers making torches. There’s a conveyor belt of people doing different things. Some women were pinning leaves together of similar size. Some were making the wood chippings for burning. Some were mixing the wood chippings with the oil from the trees and boiling it to help absorb it and make it less sticky. These girls were filling the leaves with the oily chippings and stringing them shut. One of them seemed to be particularly interested to know if Paul, the other tourist with us, was married.Pasert asked us if we wanted to see where a woman gives birth. Not the usual kind of thing you expect to hear or think about seeing but he took us around the corner to meet a 4-day old baby and her mother. They were sat on a platform outside their home, with fire burning underneath to keep them warm. Two pots of water and herbs boiled next to the platform, One for eating, one for bathing. It is tradition for a mother and new born baby to stay here for 7 to 11 days after birth. Some go to hospital to have their baby and then come home to do this. Others, as this girl did, give birth here.\nCheeky kids visiting the new babyBaci ceremony\nIn traditional Lao culture every new guest is welcomed into a home by a baci ceremony. So much preparation had gone into this and it was definitely not put on for tourists. There was a shrine of woven leaves with coconut sticks covered in white cotton strands and yellow chrysanthemums in the middle of the table surrounded by food. We were each given a plate with a banana, boiled egg, some sticky rice and a sweet banana leaf as an offering which we had to eat at some point during the evening. Then each member of the family and some of the neighbours too took some cotton tied a knot in the centre and then tied it around our wrists as we held our plate of food out and as they gave us a blessing in Lao to good health, good fortune and good luck for the future. We also had a couple of “good marriage” comments too from the older ladies! These cannot be removed for 3 days and after that cannot be cut. We felt extremely privileged to be part of this ceremony.\nThen food was served and we each had a shot of Lao-Lao whiskey passed around in the same glass for good luck. It smells terrible like Tequila but is much smoother. Though I could only take 1 shot, Matt went for 2 :)\nThis is Matt after drinking Lao-Lao :)\nAlms-giving ceremony\nWe took part in the daily alms-giving ceremony to the monks early the next day. Mrs Nhang kindly lent me a skirt to make me a bit more presentable. We had bowls of snacks and a pot of sticky rice and we kneeled in the street as the monks came past and we placed balls of sticky rice and a snack into their bowls. It was over so quickly it hardly seemed real. Just a flash of orange.\nThis is just after at 6.45am which is why I have massive bags:After a lush breakfast we were on our way again for a morning trek across rice fields…\n…to another village Ban Phon Sim where there was more creative work going on.\nGirls weaving rattan mats.

<p>It’s now 16:30 on Tuesday and just got back from a 2 day spiritual trek around the local area with a night in a homestay at a local village.</p>
<p>It started at a salt factory about 18km from Savannakhet. The Japanese had drilled for oil and instead found salt water which is pumped out of the ground and either dried in the sun for 2 to 3 days or boiled in big vats. Either way it’s manually scraped and shovelled into baskets by 40 Lao families who work there. The salt is then sent to local areas or Vietnam. It was unbelievable how manual the work is. Things which in the UK we’d automatically think a machine would do but this is providing work for local people.</p>
