Neither of us know anything about baseball but it seems a popular sport over here so we thought why not?\nWalking out of Korakuen tube station, a fairly central stop in Tokyo, you are met with a gigantic roller-coaster.\nThen you spot the Tokyo Dome and that is a monster of a building. A 55,000 seater stadium specifically for baseball. Wow.\nWe had been correctly informed by K’s House that we could obtain tickets once we got there. There were a range of tickets and us being on a tight budget we opted for the cheapest – standing room only – the assumption being it would be like at a football match where you get a stepped terrace to loiter on.\nThat was an incorrect assumption. You know when you’re at a stadium and you can wander along at the top of the seated areas to buy food \u0026 drink, this is the standing area. You find a space along the edge and lean on the barriers.\nIt was fun though. We didn’t really mind as we didn’t have to move at all. They had plenty of beer girls running up and down the steps with the keenest eyesight. The moment you raised you hand an inch one would come skipping up between the seats and pour you a pint of Kirin or Asahi. Matt suddenly loved baseball.\nOur view from our spot by the pillar.\nMatt wished he’d invested in some quality binoculars when the mid-innings entertainment came out on the pitch.\nIt’s difficult to tell from this photo but the crowd were mental. And not just crazy pockets of people like at football who start off a song and then others join in, this was mass organisation of chanting. And as soon as play started again they would all stop in unison. In their white and orange jerseys.\nWe think the home side lost. It was difficult to tell seeing as a) everything was in Japanese and b) I don’t understand anything and Matt doesn’t understand enough about baseball to know exactly what was going on. I definitely know I learned that it’s a slower game than I realised. There is a lot of standing around and not as much running as I thought. But it was a fantastic atmosphere and it was good to experience a sport that is obviously loved in Japan. It must be to have that size of stadium in the middle of the capital city!\nHungry as ever we went on an epic tube journey trying to find somewhere to eat. First stop was Roppongi. We headed out of the tube station and found ourselves in a posh apartment/ office block next to a flyover. It didn’t look like the kind of place we would find some food that would suit the kind of people we were looking like in the same clothes we’d lived in for 10 months.\nSo we popped back on the tube and tried Shinjuku instead. This turned out to be a little seedy. Lots of post-work businessmen clogging up the restaurants with randomly dressed girls hanging around the streets. Plus flashing blue lights and sirens going off here there and everywhere.\nI felt a little uncomfortable and grouchy as my rumbling stomach was getting the better of me. As we were about to give up and go back on the tube we spotted a busy fast food joint called Gindaco with guys stood at tables with beer and trays of interesting looking balls of something. It seemed more inviting than the other food places in this area.\nTurns out they were octopus balls. Well balls made of octopus. Called Takoyaki. Smothered in some sauce and cheese eaten with chopsticks.\nThey were delicious. And not just because we were starving by this point.\nMade it back to K’s and found we’d missed the free drinks evening they do every Tuesday by about 4 hours. On the plus side they’d left some of the free booze on the table so we sat and drank dodgy red wine and sake out of juice cartons whilst making paper cranes.\nThis is Matt’s example of his origami skills. Mine was shameful.\nLooking forward to a lie-in tomorrow as next on the agenda is Mount Fuji…\n","wordCount":"837","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2011-11-15T19:00:00Z","dateModified":"2011-11-15T19:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"karen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/11/16/day-316-tuesday-26th-july-kyoto-tokyo-tokyo-dome-baseball/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Matt Burns","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mattburns.co.uk/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mattburns.co.uk accesskey=h title="Matt Burns (Alt + H)">Matt Burns</a>
