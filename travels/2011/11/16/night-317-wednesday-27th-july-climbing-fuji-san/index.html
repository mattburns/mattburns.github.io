We’ve ridden camels across the desert, boated up the Ganges, hiked along the Nepalese border, zip-lined across waterfalls, trodden through jungle with elephants, tandem-navigated vineyards, thrown ourselves out of a plane and off a cable-car, crashed a campervan, scuba-dived in the Great Barrier Reef, seen the Taj Mahal, the Petronas Towers, Angkor Wat \u0026 the Sydney Opera House. Now we’re off to climb 6km through the night to reach the summit of Mt Fuji, the highest mountain in Japan, in time for sunrise.\nAfter picking up our small backpacks from K’S House we made it to the bus station with just enough time to fuel up on carbs from Burger King before catching the 19:30 bus to Fuji 5th station.\nIt was dark when we neared Fuji so we couldn’t see what was outside but we knew we must have been travelling higher and higher as our ears started to pop. When we arrived at the 5th station at 22:15 it was actually a little chilly, a feeling we hadn’t had for a week or so.\nWe were expecting crowds of walkers but the bus was barely a quarter full and only a few people were loitering around the station. There was just one building with lights on which housed the loos, lockers, essential supplies and obligatory souvenirs.\nOur flip-flops \u0026 shorts just weren’t going to cut it so we changed into our trusty hiking gear – trainers plus cotton trousers \u0026 thermals (me) / jeans (matt) – and headed out into the night.\nWell we walked out the door and had no idea where to go. There seemed to be no indication of where the trail began. Good start.\nOur detective skills failed us, we gave in and asked someone where to go. Luckily one of the sparse hikers pointed us in the right direction and we finally found the start point. Look!\nAnd the Yoshida Trail route looked simple on the map…It was 22:27:57 and off we went in a light drizzle of rain into the darkness.\nThe trail was wide and level, if not descending slightly, for half a kilometre. This is easy we thought. Then it veered right and upwards and we realised it might not be all plain sailing. We were walking over rocks and mud with only a head torch for me and a hand torch for Matt to light the way.\nEarly on we passed through a concrete tunnel with speakers and an eerie voice repeating that you should not take this route lightly. Do not wear summer clothes or shoes. Be properly prepared. Were we entering the twilight zone? Should we continue?\nAh sod it, it can’t be that bad.\nHalf an hour of walking and we had 5.3km left. 8 mins later and only 5km left. So far so good.\n 23:08 – 5.0km /343 mins to go\n  23:30 – 4.3km / 320 mins to go\n  23:57 – 3.8km / 295 mins to go\n At 3.8km to go, the sign’s estimated time was 295mins. For anyone who can’t divide that by 60 that’s pretty much 5 hours. 5 hours??? To go less than 4km. Surely not. But we were going at a pace similar to the estimates on the posts so it seemed plausible.\nThe path was wide again and zig-zagged quite steeply. We looked back over our shoulder and could see the twinkling lights of the nearest town far below in the distance. Above more twinkling lights of torches as other walkers ascended before us.\nWe were starting to tire a little now so stopped for water and nibbles. It surprised us how the altitude was getting to both of us so quickly. We were hoping there was a station coming up soon as we needed a sit-down.\nThere seemed to be light up ahead which was a good sign and then we saw the good sign of the 7th station at 00:10.\nThe station consisted of wooden huts which we couldn’t go into as you have to pay, a tuck shop and expensive toilets (200yen). Plus much needed long benches for resting on our laurels.\n 00:15 – 3.4km / 273min to go\n  00:23 – 3.2km / 262min to go\n 00:31 We came across a station that was neither 7th or 8th so possibly 7.5th station.It was a little soggy, or should I say we were a little soggy, by this point. But still chirpy 2 hours into the hike.\n 00:37 – 3.1km / 255 mins to go\n 01:01 We reach another station, possibly the 8th station, 3,020m or 3100m high we weren’t sure as two signs said two different things. 01:09 – leave to head onwards \u0026 upwards – 2.7km / 195mins to go\n  01:34 – 2.0km / 140mins to go\n 01:36 This is the 8th Station, we think. There are plenty of people hanging around here, trying to keep warm. We prop ourselves on a bench, lean back, cover and faces and have a snooze for a while.\n01:50 Now at an altitude of 3,250m. 01:53 1.8km / 125 mins to go\n  02:07 1.4km / 83 mins to go\n Perhaps we were at version 2 of the 8th station, who knows, but we decided to take a longer break as didn’t want to get to the summit too early Sunrise wasn’t due for another 2.5hours and we only had 1hour 23 mins according to the sign.\nThe wind had picked up, the temperature had dropped and the rain was pelting down now as we managed to find a semi-sheltered bench at the side of the station to wait for a while.\nAs we sat there we realised there were an awful lot of people passing us all of a sudden. Where were they coming from. We ought to get moving so we don’t get stuck behind too many of them.\n 02:50 1.3km / 80 mins to go\n Unfortunately there were many many people on the mountain now and the pace was slowing.\n 03:07 3450m high – 900m / 60mins to go\n At this point we were ascending at a snail’s pace. The guided groups had come out of their sleeping huts and started climbing all at the same time. It was gridlock. The track became slimmer and dodgier. In places we were scrambling in between large rocks with limp rope to hold onto. It was frustrating to have sat for 30mins at 8th station thinking it better to wait when we would have been better off getting to the top as soon as possible to avoid freezing to death in a queue on the side of the mountain.\nWith the crowds you could see how differently people had prepared for this, or not, in some cases. We saw one guy in three quarter length trousers and crocs. No socks, bare feet in those plastic shoes with holes in. Insane.\nThere was another man in front with his two young daughters, none dressed for wet weather or hiking in particular and no torches. The girls were crying and dad was promising they could stop at the 9th station.\nTurns out 9th station had collapsed and was no more. We don’t know what happened to them. We overtook as often as possible, even if that meant going off piste a little and pissing some people off. I had come too far to let a traffic jam stop me from getting to the top for sunrise.\nBy 04:38 the weather was pretty harsh…\n…but the end was in sight as we reached the Torii gate…\n… and not long after the 10th and final station at the top of Mt Fuji! Hooray!\nIt was 04:46. It had taken 6 hours and 18 mins to climb and it was absolutely bloody freezing.\nThey say the coldest time of the day is just before sunrise and they, whoever they are, are not darn wrong.\nBefore doing anything else our survival instincts were to cram ourselves into a corner of a shelter to thaw a little.\nMatt unfortunately for him had to pop out again so braved the cold air again to find the atrociously expensive basic loo (300yen) as I stood defrosting next to the stoves cooking canned drinks in large metal vats.\nBeing just about able to our fingers, Matt held up our souvenir banner smiling through gritted teeth with the “sunrise view” from the top of Fuji behind him.\nAt 05:03 we persuaded some other poor bugger to use our camera to take these spectacular pics. We wanted proof we’d been to the top. This is more proof of the terrible weather conditions but also that we were both still awake after over 6 hours of hiking.\nAlthough we’d taken almost a working day in time to get up the mountain we were both keen to start descending as soon as possible.\nWe made our way through the hoards and found two tracks. One going down and one going… yes up.\nWe weren’t quite at the summit. That appeared to be a little further on around the volcanic crater. Matt was enthusiastic about finishing it. I wanted to too as we’d come all that way but the chill factor was getting to me.\nDeciding to go for it we braced ourselves and fought against the icy head wind along a eerily quiet narrow track that wound its way in a foggy direction that no-one else seemed to be going in. After 5 mins we couldn’t see much of anything as we were blinded by the blustery rain and I had run out of steam. I didn’t fancy falling down the crater and no-one knowing we were there so regrettably we turned back and went downwards like the rest of the crazy people.\nOff we all trundled down through the fog. At one point we reached a fork in the track and no-one seemed to know which direction to go in. Groups were waiting for other groups and some were going one way and others another way. There were no signposts that made any sense. So we took a chance on the downhill rather than the across the mountain direction and continued on our way overtaking the rainbow of hikers.\nThen at 06:25 the cloud cover began to clear…\n06:29 then it came back 06:40 Only 4.7km / 150 mins to go 06:44 and it cleared again\n06:48 we took a rest and to take in the views as going downhill felt like harder work than up. The incline was steeper and the red clay soil was soft underfoot and was like walking through sand. Others taking a well deserved rest too\n 07:21 A 20 minute queue for the loo halfway down a mountain. Can’t beat the views. Shame about the eco loos which were so disgusting I can’t write any more as want to erase it from my memory. Perhaps it was more shocking because we were in Japan one of the most advanced and cleanest countries on the planet. If you’re ever on Mt Fuji and can wait another hour the next loos are slightly better and you won’t have to cross your legs forever and a day.\n07:45 Look how wide awake we look, how long Matt’s beard has grown and how white my hair has become all in 9hours!07:59 The views are getting better and better\n08:13 Breakfast stop of sushi balls 08:23 Good stuff 08:28 Almost back 08:50 and we made it! And do you know what? I forgot to take a darn photo! Curses!\nOur bus back had been booked for 11:00 but we were able to queue at the bus ticket office and change them to 10:00 which meant only a short wait sat on the pavement at 5th station.\nAs we sat there bus loads of walkers arrived ready for their trip up the mountain (and as we had neared the bottom we’d passed other people on their way up), we thought how great it was to have done it and be on the way back rather than at the beginning not knowing what was in store.\nBack in Tokyo by 12:30 it felt like another world and it had all been a dream.\n So after a generally negative blog, what did we really think of Fuji-san? We have never been so cold in our lives. We thought Sandakphu was chilly. That was tropical compared to this. Our lungs compressed until we could hardly breathe, our hands were so numb we couldn’t put our gloves on properly without using our teeth, we were soaked to the bone, tired out, aching limbs, too many people and there was nothing to see at the top.\nBUT it is one of the best experiences we’ve had of this entire trip. It it a massive achievement to have climbed the highest mountain in Japan and we feel bloody great about it. What an amazing high to go home on (excuse the pun). Love it.\n","wordCount":"2164","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2011-11-15T19:05:00Z","dateModified":"2011-11-15T19:05:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"karen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/11/16/night-317-wednesday-27th-july-climbing-fuji-san/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Matt Burns","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mattburns.co.uk/favicon.ico"}}}</script>

Night 317 Wednesday 27th July – Climbing Fuji-san

<div class=post-content><p>This is it, our final adventure of the trip. We’ve ridden camels across the desert, boated up the Ganges, hiked along the Nepalese border, zip-lined across waterfalls, trodden through jungle with elephants, tandem-navigated vineyards, thrown ourselves out of a plane and off a cable-car, crashed a campervan, scuba-dived in the Great Barrier Reef, seen the Taj Mahal, the Petronas Towers, Angkor Wat & the Sydney Opera House. Now we’re off to climb 6km through the night to reach the summit of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji>Mt Fuji</a>, the highest mountain in Japan, in time for sunrise.</p>

</p>
<p>The station consisted of wooden huts which we couldn’t go into as you have to pay, a tuck shop and expensive toilets (200yen). Plus much needed long benches for resting on our laurels.</p>

<p>00:23 – 3.2km / 262min to go</p>

<p>00:31 We came across a station that was neither 7th or 8th so possibly 7.5th  station.<img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080735.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>It was a little soggy, or should I say <em>we</em> were a little soggy, by this point. But still chirpy 2 hours into the hike.</p>

<p>01:01 We reach another station, possibly the 8th station, 3,020m or 3100m high we weren’t sure as two signs said two different things.<img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080744.jpg alt>

<p>01:36 This is the 8th Station, we think. There are plenty of people hanging around here, trying to keep warm. We prop ourselves on a bench, lean back, cover and faces and have a snooze for a while.</p>

<p>Perhaps we were at version 2 of the 8th station, who knows, but we decided to take a longer break as didn’t want to get to the summit too early Sunrise wasn’t due for another 2.5hours and we only had 1hour 23 mins according to the sign.</p>
<p>The wind had picked up, the temperature had dropped and the rain was pelting down now as we managed to find a semi-sheltered bench at the side of the station to wait for a while.</p>
<p>As we sat there we realised there were an awful lot of people passing us all of a sudden. Where were they coming from. We ought to get moving so we don’t get stuck behind too many of them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>02:50 1.3km / 80 mins to go</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080758.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>Unfortunately there were many many people on the mountain now and the pace was slowing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>03:07 3450m high – 900m / 60mins to go</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point we were ascending at a snail’s pace. The guided groups had come out of their sleeping huts and started climbing all at the same time. It was gridlock. The track became slimmer and dodgier. In places we were scrambling in between large rocks with limp rope to hold onto. It was frustrating to have sat for 30mins at 8th station thinking it better to wait when we would have been better off getting to the top as soon as possible to avoid freezing to death in a queue on the side of the mountain.</p>
<p>With the crowds you could see how differently people had prepared for this, or not, in some cases. We saw one guy in three quarter length trousers and crocs. No socks, bare feet in those plastic shoes with holes in. Insane.</p>
<p>There was another man in front with his two young daughters, none dressed for wet weather or hiking in particular and no torches. The girls were crying and dad was promising they could stop at the 9th station.</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080760.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>Turns out 9th station had collapsed and was no more. We don’t know what happened to them. We overtook as often as possible, even if that meant going off piste a little and pissing some people off. I had come too far to let a traffic jam stop me from getting to the top for sunrise.</p>
<p>By 04:38 the weather was pretty harsh…</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080761_thumb.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>…but the end was in sight as we reached the Torii gate…</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080762.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>… and not long after the 10th and final station at the top of Mt Fuji! Hooray!</p>
<p>It was 04:46. It had taken 6 hours and 18 mins to climb and it was absolutely bloody freezing.</p>
<p>They say the coldest time of the day is just before sunrise and they, whoever they are, are not darn wrong.</p>
<p>Before doing anything else our survival instincts were to cram ourselves into a corner of a shelter to thaw a little.</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_9732.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>Matt unfortunately for him had to pop out again so braved the cold air again to find the atrociously expensive basic loo (300yen) as I stood defrosting next to the stoves cooking canned drinks in large metal vats.</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080770.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>Being just about able to our fingers, Matt held up our souvenir banner smiling through gritted teeth with the “sunrise view” from the top of Fuji behind him.</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080780.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>At 05:03 we persuaded some other poor bugger to use our camera to take these spectacular pics. We wanted proof we’d been to the top. This is more proof of the terrible weather conditions but also that we were both still awake after over 6 hours of hiking.</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080781.jpg alt>

</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/fuji-collage1.jpg alt="The entire journey up in a snapshot.">
</p>
<p>Although we’d taken almost a working day in time to get up the mountain we were both keen to start descending as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We made our way through the hoards and found two tracks. One going down and one going… yes up.</p>
<p>We weren’t quite at the summit. That appeared to be a little further on around the volcanic crater. Matt was enthusiastic about finishing it. I wanted to too as we’d come all that way but the chill factor was getting to me.</p>
<p>Deciding to go for it we braced ourselves and fought against the icy head wind along a eerily quiet narrow track that wound its way in a foggy direction that no-one else seemed to be going in. After 5 mins we couldn’t see much of anything as we were blinded by the blustery rain and I had run out of steam. I didn’t fancy falling down the crater and no-one knowing we were there so regrettably we turned back and went downwards like the rest of the crazy people.</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_9737.jpg alt>
</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_9738.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>Off we all trundled down through the fog. At one point we reached a fork in the track and no-one seemed to know which direction to go in. Groups were waiting for other groups and some were going one way and others another way. There were no signposts that made any sense. So we took a chance on the downhill rather than the across the mountain direction and continued on our way overtaking the rainbow of hikers.</p>
<p>Then at 06:25 the cloud cover began to clear…</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080783.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>06:29 then it came back <img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080791.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>06:40 Only 4.7km / 150 mins to go <img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080801.jpg alt>
</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080800_thumb.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>06:44 and it cleared again</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080806.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>06:48 we took a rest and to take in the views as going downhill felt like harder work than up. The incline was steeper and the red clay soil was soft underfoot and was like walking through sand. <img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080814.jpg alt>
</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_9748.jpg alt>

<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_9750.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>Others taking a well deserved rest too</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080821.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>07:21 A 20 minute queue for the loo halfway down a mountain. Can’t beat the views. Shame about the eco loos which were so disgusting I can’t write any more as want to erase it from my memory. Perhaps it was more shocking because we were in Japan one of the most advanced and cleanest countries on the planet. If you’re ever on Mt Fuji and can wait another hour the next loos are slightly better and you won’t have to cross your legs forever and a day.</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080823.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>07:45 Look how wide awake we look, how long Matt’s beard has grown and how white my hair has become all in 9hours!<img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080824.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>07:59 The views are getting better and better</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080826.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>08:13 Breakfast stop of sushi balls <img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080828.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>08:23 Good stuff <img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080829.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>08:28 Almost back <img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080833.jpg alt>
</p>
<p>08:50 and we made it! And do you know what? I forgot to take a darn photo! Curses!</p>
<p>Our bus back had been booked for 11:00 but we were able to queue at the bus ticket office and change them to 10:00 which meant only a short wait sat on the pavement at 5th station.</p>
<p>As we sat there bus loads of walkers arrived ready for their trip up the mountain (and as we had neared the bottom we’d passed other people on their way up), we thought how great it was to have done it and be on the way back rather than at the beginning not knowing what was in store.</p>
<p>Back in Tokyo by 12:30 it felt like another world and it had all been a dream.</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1080835.jpg alt>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So after a generally negative blog, what did we really think of Fuji-san? We have never been so cold in our lives. We thought Sandakphu was chilly. That was tropical compared to this. Our lungs compressed until we could hardly breathe, our hands were so numb we couldn’t put our gloves on properly without using our teeth, we were soaked to the bone, tired out, aching limbs, too many people and there was nothing to see at the top.</p>
<p>BUT it is one of the best experiences we’ve had of this entire trip. It it a massive achievement to have climbed the highest mountain in Japan and we feel bloody great about it. What an amazing high to go home on (excuse the pun). Love it.</p>
