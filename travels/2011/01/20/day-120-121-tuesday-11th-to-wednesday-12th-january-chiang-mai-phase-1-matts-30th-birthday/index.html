As soon as we arrived at Butterfly we were met by smiling helpful people offering to carry bags. Whilst we waited to check in we were brought pineapple juice.

It was bigger than the flat we used to own. The bedroom was so big it had a sofa in it. There was a small side garden with a table, chairs and canopy umbrella. The bathroom was something else. It had a bathtub. Not just any kind of bathtub. But a jacuzzi bathtub. And the room had folding glass doors that led into the back garden with an outdoor shower!\nI had emailed them to ask them if 1. would it be possible to have breakfast in our room on 12th and 2. did they know anywhere I could get a birthday cake from. They couldn’t have been more helpful. They emailed a local cake shop URL http://www.loveatfirstbite-cm.com to me so I could choose the cake and they arranged for their shuttle driver to pick it up. Plus instead of eating in the room they said I could reserve a table overlooking the river.\nTrying to get Matt out of bed and ready for brekkie at 9am was a challenge though. He couldn’t understand why I wanted to get up so “early” on his birthday!\nThey were so sweet at Butterfly. Our table was laid out miles away from anyone else with a vase of roses and they brought us any food we wanted.\nFollowed by the most delicious dark chocolate cake… Spent the rest of the day having pressies, lounging by the pool, freezing our backsides off in the pool (and getting a teeny bit of exercise for once) and having chocolate cake and beer in the Jacuzzi. :)\nCaught the 6pm shuttlebus to Riverside for a pre-dinner drink followed by a scrummy dinner at the nearby restaurant XXXX with a sofa for seats overlooking the river. Treated ourselves to a bottle of Cabernet-Merlot. The first full-sized bottle of red in 4 months ( a record for us) which was kindly poured by the staff mouthful by mouthful. It took us hours to drink that bottle.\nEnded up back in Riverside to watch some local bands doing excellent covers of bands we actually know like the Killers and drinking beer and rum and finally whiskey with the locals. Everyone was coming into the bar with a bottle of Jack Daniels or some other kind of whiskey and the barmaid brings jugs of water and ice over as a mixer.\nAll in all a pretty good day. Matt does agree with everything I’ve written here. I did ask him to write it as it was his birthday but he couldn’t be arsed [I agree with that too. –Ed] so my account will have to do.\n","wordCount":"740","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2011-01-20T04:38:54Z","dateModified":"2011-01-20T04:38:54Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"karen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/01/20/day-120-121-tuesday-11th-to-wednesday-12th-january-chiang-mai-phase-1-matts-30th-birthday/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Matt Burns","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mattburns.co.uk/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
