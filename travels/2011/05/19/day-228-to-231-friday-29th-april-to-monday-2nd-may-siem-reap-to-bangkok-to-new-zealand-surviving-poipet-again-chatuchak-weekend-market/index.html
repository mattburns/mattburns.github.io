Our coach left Siem Reap at 8.15 (with Matt sat in the guide’s seat as they seemed to have run out of usual passenger seats by the time we were told it was OK to board) and after 2 pointless stops we were at the border at 11:30. 1:15 we piled into a minibus and by 5pm (less than 9hours since SR) we were dropped off at the side of the main road in Siam to save us being taken pointlessly to Khao San Road. If you don’t mind seeing your life flash before you go with Hep Travel in Siem Reap. They’ll get you there faster! And all for $8.\nSome interesting sights on the way:\n3 pigs (possibly live) strapped upside down to the back of a moped wiggling their trotters.\n2 guys in army gear sat in the back of a pickup with rifles heading in the direction of the Thai/Cambodian conflict area.\nA transport truck carrying far too many pigs for the max capacity with urine and who knows what else pouring out the back as the truck took each corner.\nSo back in lovely Sunflower Place for the 4th and final time this trip. You probably think it’s boring to keep going back to the same place. Yep. But it’s easy!! I now understand Dad’s beef curry rice \u0026 chips philosophy. Mmmm beef curry…\nKind of realised we’re off to New Zealand and that it will also be autumn/winter when we get there. Our backpacks are full of vest tops (well maybe mine), shorts and flip-flops. Not so good in chilly climes. So we headed to Chatuchak weekend market and what a place. I am definitely going back there next time I’m in Bangkok. Must remember to book Monday morning flights 😀\nIt is easy to get there from Silom. 30 min metro journey and absolutely huge. They sell everything here. I mean everything. Including one of the cutest things I’ve ever seen. A baby bunny in a dress. Honestly.\nThe market is an (I hate this word but I need to use it) eclectic mix of stalls. There are so many clothes stalls but all selling different stuff from cheap second-hand stuff to not-so cheap trendy stuff. I bought some lush skinny jeans for 150THB. Can you believe it. £3. They are a perfect fit. Matt \u0026 I both came away with a new outfit including a coat for less than 20 quid . It’s worth the flight cost to go there.\nLove Bangkok. You never know who or what you’re going to see there.\nSilom Road Mr. Cruise at a shopping mall in Siam. Matt found him extremely attractive. Not sure the feeling was mutual. Another mall Chatuchak market Now on a flight to New Zealand (via Sydney). Yep we are finally on our way. Still doesn’t feel real. I have always wanted to go there and now it’s happening. Woop! And we have red wine. And we had cheese. And a mini mars bar. The most exquisite chocolate ever (after 8 months of no chocolate bars – of course the peanut M\u0026Ms and Minstrels mum sent to us with Wend \u0026 Steve were yum too. But a solid high-calorific mars bar. Mmmmm).\nYou may be surprised that I managed to drag Matt away from his computer for long enough to go a) shopping and b) to a different country. It’s OK. We’ve been up til 2am every night for a while and wake up early enough to check emails and stats. Plus we have both been dreaming about it. So he is sleep-coding. Is that possible?\nBye-bye Asia. Thanks for a fab 7 months, 18 days. We will miss you.\nBut there’s more of the world to see.\nHello New Zealand….\n[although we almost didn’t make it or so we thought. Had a mini-crisis earlier. We couldn’t find the passports. 10 mins before checkout. Where the hell were they? We’d had them to check in 3 days ago. What, where, when, how? Panic set in. I lost 5 years off my life straightaway. Even Matt panicked. He didn’t say anything. That’s what made me realise he was worried too. It took 20mins of unpacking and flapping until Matt finally found them. Do you know I hate security boxes. They are fab to have in your room but they have a habit of hiding the most important things along their innards. I checked it 3 times. THREE TIMES! There they were sat all innocently along the side of the safe. Panic over. Heart attack averted. Grey hairs multiplied. We were on our way. (By the way for anyone getting a cab from Silom to Bangkok airport it cost us 320THB INCLUDING 2 tolls)]\nSCF update: traffic is still increasing, more blogs are linking to or re-writing the original articles. Twitter is still going insane. At least 1 tweet every minute about it. Incredible.\nThings are getting serious. Matt did a phone interview with a guy from BBC Lincolnshire last night from our hotel room in Bangkok. It’ll be aired on Monday 9th May at around 18:30 as part of their Technology focus slot.
