It’s a little like being back at home except it’s still roasting.\nAly had some bad news. During the storm on Saturday the lightning had struck everyone’s homes in the area killing everyone’s TVs, her stereo, modem and her husband’s PC. There is a phone mast just next door and so it must have attracted the lightning. In the UK I’m sure you wouldn’t see a mast so blatantly close to homes. It’s ridiculous. Aly is worried about the hazards for the children with the flooding and the play area being metal. It means more fund-raising is needed to make it safe for the coming months as the storms will only worsen.\nTried the hyper drink today. Every break-time the kids run round the back of the school to buy snacks \u0026 E number filled refreshments the lady with the ice crusher over the back fence.\nWhich means after break-time they’re hyperactive and it’s usually the best time to play a game as it’s rare they’ll sit still for more than 5 minutes.\nThe hyper drink is a plastic cup of crushed-ice with red syrup, some sweet goo \u0026 condensed milk over the top eaten with a brightly coloured plastic spoon. The vendor of such delights retrieves a large block of ice from her big ice chiller and grinds it down into shavings on a more sophisticated iron version of Mr. Frosty. It’s ingenious.\nI didn’t feel too well that evening, so I wonder if it was an overdose of sugar!\nTuesday was the complete opposite weather wise. It was hot hot hot with clear blue skies. Matt was lovely and cool in our A/C room when I headed out into the heat and started burning up at 9am.\nI’m not sure what happened today. In in the morning class I had one of the youngest kids crying because he was being picked on by an older kid, muddy tears pouring down his cheek and then this afternoon another kid refusing to join in or listen. Maybe it was the heat. I don’t know if I helped either situation at all. Having some woman babbling to you in a language you don’t quite understand when you’re upset can’t be that good. Both managed to come round and start smiling again thankfully. And Dyna the second boy managed to snap out of it enough to start a game of hangman with me at break-time to distract me from marking the homework. 😀\nWednesday I found a hit of a game. A variation on Boggle which I borrowed from a UK kids website. I wrote a 4 x 5 table of letters on the board including letters of words I had taught this week. They had to try and come up with words using the letters in the table and they got a point for each letter. They started looking at the dictionary and writing words up their arms to get as many as possible. An organised game soon turned to chaos. But hey they were having fun and learning new words!\nToday, was my last day at SHAC and it was sad. Not because my fan design was terrible and one of the kids had to show me how to make a better one. We all made fans because it was stifling hot in the classroom. And not because I managed to lose all of my games of Thumb War, even with the tiniest girl in the class. Even reading a book to them was a hit for once. My earlier attempts of reading had gone down like a ton of bricks. They loved The Snowball and I loved reading it to them. It was sad because they genuinely acted like they didn’t want me to leave. Although it could have been the sweets I’d brought in and used as bribes when they behaved themselves 😀 I’d had a few hugs during the past couple weeks but this time I had a massive group hug from eight of the smallest kids in one go. It was so sweet.\nAfter class we had a mass photo of me with all the kids doing the smiling hearts symbol and Christina and Dyna (the boy who had been upset in my class on Tuesday) just didn’t want to let go. I had to keep the tears back.\nNathaly asked me when was I coming back. I had to truthfully say I didn’t know but I hope to one day. I really do. I wish I could have stayed longer.\nAs I left she and Christina brought me the hugest bunches of wild purple flowers that filled the basket on my bike. Just down the road another girl gave me a yellow flower and yet another girl gave me a bunch of leaves.\nMy morning class My afternoon class Other memories of SHAC\nThrowing a paper ball to start a conversation practice session and hitting a kid on the head with it straightaway.\nBuying the SHAC volunteer T-shirt and wearing it with pride, really feeling part of it.\nBeing welcomed by Aly and her family so openly and fully.\nGetting lots of high fives.\nThe natural generosity of the kids. Earlier this week I was humbled by one of the girls giving me a packet of Snack Bi-Do (like Skips) as a present. She’s a bit of a tomboy and always comes to school with mud on her face and appears very poor.\nMatt became addicted to them so I queued up with the kids at the local shop to buy in bulk. I’d been given a packet of dried peas by the girl who beat me at Thumb Wars and postcards of Angkor Wat by another girl who had only been in my class twice. I assumed she’d been away with her family for Khmer New Year.\nMy journey to and from SHAC. Each day I became more familiar to the people I passed and so would get hellos from different people. And lots of “hello teacher”. Especially at one of the small communes where Aly told me 9 families lived in a number of wooden houses. They’d had no toilet until she managed to get the money together and had recently built two toilets inside the commune. As I passed on my last day leaving SHAC the tiny children who normally shout out came running out to say hello to me. They couldn’t have been more than 3 years old. All five of them were barely dressed and had muddy blotches here and there but all five of them were beaming with the biggest grins. I put my hand out to them and they all started holding my hand. It was such a lovely experience. I would like to have a photo to share that moment with everyone but I didn’t want to get my camera out and ruin the moment. Instead I have that wonderful unspoilt memory to myself.\nAnother striking experience happened moments after as I got off my bike to avoid some pot-holes just as a young boy came out of his house. He was smiling at me so I said “high 5” and as I put my hand up he flinched away. I lowered my hand so he could clap it and then tried high-5 again and he did it and grinned. I was so relieved. It shocked me that his first reaction was that I was going to hit him. It seems that happens a lot here.\n","wordCount":"1276","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2011-05-19T06:06:38Z","dateModified":"2011-05-19T06:06:38Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"karen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/05/19/day-224-to-227-monday-25th-to-thursday-28th-april-2nd-week-teaching-at-shac/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Matt Burns","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mattburns.co.uk/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mattburns.co.uk accesskey=h title="Matt Burns (Alt + H)">Matt Burns</a>
