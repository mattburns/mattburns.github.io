Alarm set for 5am, we dragged ourselves out at 5.15. Mr Sun was already half up but it was still pretty. The tide was out which reveals lots of old coral rocks and leaves lots of sealife behind like bigger rock-camouflaged crabs and teeny blue fishes swimming through the coral tunnels.\nHired a moped and headed to the jetty to buy ferry tickets for Wednesday. Matt offered to “queue” whilst I sat and alternated between watching him get elbowed out the way by 80-year old women and watching two kids (baby goats) skipping around trying not to get run over by rickshaws whilst eating anything they could get their teeth into.\nWent on a bit of a joyride towards the south of the island and found the elephant training camp which was deserted apart from one guy in a hut whose only words were “Don’t come back”. We didn’t realise at the time that the elephants are trained for logging and later two went stomping down the road as we were sat at a cafe covered in logging chains with men shouting at them continuously. It was terrible really and we’re glad we hadn’t seen any at the training camp.\nIn the evening we went back to Radha Nagar beach (beach no. 7) and kind of watched the sun set behind clouds. An effigy from the recent festival was sat on the beach without a head. So Matt felt obliged….\nThe beaches here are covered in hermit crabs of all sizes plus small white crabs that are almost invisible and can move extremely quickly. I have a video of one moving in and out of it’s home in the sand. Unfortunately videos are a pain to upload on here so will have to put in on YouTube. Instead here’s a photo of the patterns they make on the sand:\nAnd here’s a hermit crab:\n Talking of videos we have a great one of the moped trip. Will have to remember to upload that one too sometime.\nOur last night in the hut on Havelock and had a lovely surprise when I popped to the bathroom at 2am. I usually take a few seconds to survey the bathroom to check for cockroaches so you can imagine my pleasure at spotting a snake slithering around the floor by the loo. I thought I was going to have a heart attack! Fortunately our bathroom is quite long and the door is at the opposite end to the loo so didn’t get too close to it, shot out, slammed the door shut and shouted for my knight in white shining armour to save me. Matt clambered sleepily out of bed and apparently his first thought was where’s my camera? But as I was in such a state he bravely went to investigate minus the camera whilst I flitted around babbling about the possibilities it could be hiding behind the loo and be ready to jump out at any moment. But the rascal had fled the scene so was probably more scared of me than I was of it. Who knows what we’d have done if it had still been there though. Anyone know how to catch a snake? Matt probably would have been setting the ISO on his 7D in an instant.\nI’m glad that it occurred on our last night and not our first otherwise I’m not sure I could have stayed in that hut for 11 more nights. Matt had often used the bathroom in the middle of the night and not switched on the light so as not to disturb me. Wonder what creatures could have been lurking in there then…\n More sunbathing Wednesday and as we looked at the clear turquoise sea with other islands on the horizon we realised we could have easily spent a few more days doing absolutely nothing on the beach and maybe another day of diving. But good to leave on a high and we know we want to see much more of the world too.\nSo back to Port Blair we went on our ferry sat in “seat” class this time. Which was cheaper and comfy enough. We just had more people to stare at us or not very subtly try to take our photos. As we were the only westerners in the room. But we’re getting used to the stares. Even those when you look up and they keep staring.\nManaged to get back into Aashiaanaa Guest House and found the LP recommended restaurant Lighthouse Residency for dinner. We felt like we were in a Fawlty Towers episode. All the waiters wore black waistcoats and bowties like Manuel. And we had about 4 guys trying to take our food \u0026 drinks order at different times. We’d order from one, another would come and ask us what we wanted to drink and we’d try and explain that we’d already ordered but he didn’t understand and tried taking our order again. Then they didn’t have what I wanted so I had to choose again and then a 3rd guy came and tried to take our order again and trying to explain when the others had once again disappeared was hysterical. That makes no sense whatsover and doesn’t sound funny at all does it. Guess you had to be there.\n","wordCount":"954","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2010-11-18T13:24:55Z","dateModified":"2010-11-18T13:24:55Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"karen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/18/days-56-to-58-monday-8th-to-wednesday-10th-november-havelock-island-port-blair/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Matt Burns","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mattburns.co.uk/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
