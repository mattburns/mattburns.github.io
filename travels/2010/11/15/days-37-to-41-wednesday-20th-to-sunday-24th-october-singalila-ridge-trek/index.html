What better time to do it than whilst Matt has his first shave in 6 weeks. I could be writing a novel here :)\nShort version:\nThe trek was amazing. There were bad points, there always are with us two. But the result at the end was phenomenal. The views at sunrise across the Himalaya mountain range spectacular, breathtaking.\nFrom Sandakphu, 3600m high, we could see a looming Khangchendzonga (Kanchenjunga) (8598m – correction from earlier post – this is the 2nd highest in Himalaya, 3rd highest in the world after Everest and K2), the Three Sisters, Makalu and the tip of Mt Everest. Wow. Worth every drop of rain and every metre climbed and every aching limb coming back down.\nLong version:\nDay 1 – legged it to the trekking place arriving at 7.10am as taxi was due between 7 and 7.30. Sat there til just gone 8 and as the Jeep pulled up I realised I still had the hotel key in my pocket. Doh. Stupid cow. We called the hotel and arranged for them to pick it up from the trekking office – yes they knew the one – next to the Pizza place, right? It’s good to know we’re not the only ones who navigate by food related places.\nMet lovely Basque country couple Arancha and Felix who were going to have to put up with us two for the next 5 days. I think they did just about.\nJeep man took us to Mane Bhajang (2134m) near the Nepalese border and dropped us off for lovely porridge with fresh coconut and veg momos at some woman’s kitchen where her kids were playing an unusual table game with numbered discs shooting them into 4 corner pockets. Our guide turned up at that point and whisked us off up the steepest hill ever in the hottest heat ever! I was not prepared. I haven’t done any exercise since Fitball 6 weeks ago and I was knackered walking around Darjeeling. That aside it was good to burn some calories and I thought after 4 days of this I’ll be leaner \u0026 fitter :)\nAfter a short while the views became obscured by thick cloud and the mist descended but it was nice to cool down and walk along the border path. The guide now and again would point to the right of the path and say “India” and point to the left and say “Nepal”.\nAn hour or so in we stopped for chai. A common occurrence during the whole trek that came to be expected and we were disappointed when we didn’t get our frequent hit of sugary milky tea. (Both Matt \u0026 I cannot drink tea without sugar now. I used to detest it and spent years convincing my dad to give it up. I feel such a hypocrite.)\n[ By the way Matt has now finished shaving his beard off and is scaring me with his young man looks ! ]\nStopped again for lunch of Wai Wai (chow mein noodle soup) and chai at Megma plus a quick squizz around the monastery which had 108 books bound between wooden planks and material, 108 small golden buddhas and 108 ornaments in the shape of different Hindu gods. No idea why I’m afraid. Must look it up someday.\nThe Hindu gods didn’t smile on us from then on as the heavens opened and it poured down between there and Tumling. We encased ourselves in waterproof jackets, gators and ponchos and plodded on through many streams pretending to be roads. Arrived at Tumling (across the Nepal border) and were shepherded into a cosy room with a other walkers huddle around an open fire. We took off our wet gear and was just about to settled in when our guide gestured we had to move on as the nice greedy lodge owner had already given our rooms to someone else. Back on went the rainmac, the poncho, the gators and out into the rain. 2km more to go he said.\nTrundling on 2km came and went as the lodges were again full. Just 2km further. The sun was setting now so there we were the guide, followed by Felix, followed by Arancha, followed by Matt \u0026 I about half a km behind heading for our last chance of a bed before darkness hit.\nWe made it to the next village where finally there was space and were led upstairs to an attic room for the 4 of us to share. Interesting but fine. It had blankets, electricity and was dry. Soup was delivered to our room and we thought that was it. Then we were invited across the street to someone else’s house for dinner of dahl, chapati, potatoes and enough rice to feed the five thousand.\nGuide said brekkie at 8am so we all agreed on a 7:30 alarm and nodded off at what must have been as late as 8.30pm.\nDay 2 – 7am the guide is knocking on the door. He wanted to show us the view – you could see a glimpse of Mt Everest and Makalu from the edge of the village. Amazing. Also got to see some chicks and baby goats too. Soooo cute! Looking around in daylight made us realise how remote a place it was and it’s unbelievable that people live in these places so far from towns. Jeeps can get up there but it must take them hours as the roads are barely passable.\nAfter more food at the neighbours for brekkie, we headed off towards Kali Pokri (3100m). It didn’t take long for the rains to come in but luckily we stopped for chai twice on the way. And arrived at 1:30pm in torrential rain.\nAgain we settled in at the first lodging our guide took us too. But then he changed his mind and we waterproofed up again and moved further down the village. This time we had our own rooms. The communal area was basically the family’s front room where cross-eyed grandad was feeding baby and we sat on plastic chairs (they love plastic garden chairs here) huddled around a makeshift fire from a spare wheel and charcoal burning in the middle of the wooden hut.\nAs the rain persisted we stayed in that same 6ft square space for 6hours, only moving from fire to table to eat lunch \u0026 dinner and then back again. Played batteships with A \u0026 F to pass the time. Tried the local/homemade brew called Tsomba (i think) which consisted of fermented millet served in a vessel that looked like a small barrel which you topped up with hot water for as long as you wanted to drink the stuff through the wooden straws. It tasted similar to liqueur or mulled wine. Very warming. Grandad seemed to really enjoy his. No wonder he was cross-eyed.\n Day 3 – up earlier hoping to miss the rain but it was relentless and we ventured out all suited up again (after good brekkie of thick pancakes and hot banana). Luckily it didn’t rain too much although it stayed misty and the colder air was good to move up the steepest part to Sandakphu. No chai stop this time as Felix wasn’t feeling well and we all decided it was better to just get there as quickly as possible. Unbelievably we were at our final highest destination by 10:30am. We were worried it meant another day of sitting around trying to pass the time as the weather was still poor. Luckily the weather cleared up mid afternoon and we ventured out to explore. Can’t say there was loads to see apart from clouds and a few hills but it was nice to wander around and get some fresh air with the sun shining.\nSat on a huge rock we watched the sun set over the hills as a group of Indian guys sat on a higher rock took our photo then started singing “One Love” by Blue completely out of tune. In the distance Snoop Dogg came blasting across the airways from a nearby lodge.\nThe temperature dropped and it was blooming freezing that night as we huddled together in a single bed in our “ensuite” room (see photo).\nDay 5 – guide had said we should be up at 5:30 to see sunrise. He had a good feeling. 5:05 there’s a knock at the door. “Come come” he says. We get up as quickly as possible. 5:15 rat-a-tat-tat. He’s waiting for us so after applying 3 pairs of socks, 2 pairs of trousers, 2 tops, 2 jumpers, a hat and grabbing a blanket we head out to the view point. And what a view. The sun is rising in the east as the moon sets in the west. The mountains are clear of clouds and as the sky brightens the colours illuminating Khangchendzonga are beautiful. In the distance the air clears more and we can see the Nepalese mountain ranges of The Three Sisters and Everest and Makalu. Wow. It just made all the effort through the pouring rain worth it. We were so so lucky. The day before visibility had been practically zero. Today it was perfect conditions. Like being on top of the world.\nThis one’s Mt Everest:\nUnbelievably just as we left Sandakphu to make our descent around 8am the clouds also descended and covered the mountains rapidly. It was as though they’d never been there.\nWe were headed for Rimbik at 2100m and 20km away so it was walking solidly downhill. As we moved away from the Nepalese border and downwards the landscape changed frequently. Wooded areas almost Forest of Dean like and then dense bamboo bushes 10 feet tall each side (we kept out eyes peeled for red panda but none in sight) back to huge trees and jungle-like palms with rivers, rapids and waterfalls. Then openness across a huge valley with remains of a forest fire from ‘88 and further down to agricultural land.\nFirst chai of the day was had at Gurdum (2300m), 3hours after we left Sandakphu so we were gasping. Gurdum was so pretty. Just a few houses on the side of a hill painted blue and green. With fuchsias and chrysanthemums and countless other flowers \u0026 herbs growing in pots lined up alongside the buildings. It was kind of like Calamity Jane’s house after “a woman’s touch”.\nLunch was at Goparma Lodge in Shrikhola (1900m) and we got to choose what we wanted to eat! No rice for us :) The lodge was on the riverside so Matt was off jumping onto rocks to capture the perfect pic of blurred water.\nWe left Shrikola across a dubious bridge and sadly passed a sick horse at the side of the track. It was awful to see it lying there struggling to get up. We have seen too many animals that have died or are about to. I guess if people can’t afford to buy themselves medicine they can’t do it for their animals. This idyllic place was also marred by the rubbish we saw at the side of the river. It seems all waste ends up in the water here. Such a shame.\nThe rest of the route to Rimbik was on more of a road which wound around the hills where we passed donkeys and horses carrying goods and saw many houses built of stilts. An old woman was sat on a pile of granite stones breaking more rocks and further along men were laying new tarmac using what looked like the same kind of rocks – a lot of hard manual labour.\n Reaching the lodge at Rimbik just after 4pm was a relief after a full day’s walking downhill in good weather and only one chai since breakfast. We were getting withdrawal symptoms. The lodge had a view of Sikkim to the north-east and Darjeeling to the south-east and a shower with hot water. Lush.\nThe only downside this time were the paper-thin walls between us and the pissed honeymoon couple in the room next door. Indians aren’t known for being quiet and there were far too many noises coming from their room than we would have liked to hear. Especially when the guy ended up being very ill from drinking too much. Ugh!\nDay 5 – We were planning on a lie-in as the jeep wasn’t coming til 8:30 but the beautiful sunrise together with our mousey neighbours leaving at 6am we were up and having brekkie by 7:30am. A first for us. Halfway through our toast at 7:50 the guide comes into the cafe and says the jeep is here we have to leave! Why change the habit of a lifetime?\n4 hours later and we’re back in Darjeeling. As I get out the car I realise I can hardly walk. My quads are seized up and I’m walking around like John Wayne again. Matt isn’t much better. Seems we’ve both turned into old people after 6 weeks of no exercise. Good job we did the beginner’s trek.\n","wordCount":"2192","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2010-11-14T20:19:11Z","dateModified":"2010-11-14T20:19:11Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"karen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/15/days-37-to-41-wednesday-20th-to-sunday-24th-october-singalila-ridge-trek/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Matt Burns","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mattburns.co.uk/favicon.ico"}}}</script>

Can’t say there was loads to see apart from clouds and a few hills but it was nice to wander around and get some fresh air with the sun shining.</p><p>Sat on a huge rock we watched the sun set over the hills as a group of Indian guys sat on a higher rock took our photo then started singing “One Love” by Blue completely out of tune. In the distance Snoop Dogg came blasting across the airways from a nearby lodge.</p><p>The temperature dropped and it was blooming freezing that night as we huddled together in a single bed in our “ensuite” room (see photo).</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2010/11/P1020012.jpg alt=P1020012>

</p><p>Day 5 – guide had said we should be up at 5:30 to see sunrise. He had a good feeling. 5:05 there’s a knock at the door. “Come come” he says. We get up as quickly as possible. 5:15 rat-a-tat-tat. He’s waiting for us so after applying 3 pairs of socks, 2 pairs of trousers, 2 tops, 2 jumpers, a hat and grabbing a blanket we head out to the view point. And what a view. The sun is rising in the east as the moon sets in the west. The mountains are clear of clouds and as the sky brightens the colours illuminating Khangchendzonga are beautiful. In the distance the air clears more and we can see the Nepalese mountain ranges of The Three Sisters and Everest and Makalu. Wow. It just made all the effort through the pouring rain worth it. We were so so lucky. The day before visibility had been practically zero. Today it was perfect conditions. Like being on top of the world.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2010/11/P1020080.jpg alt=P1020080>

</p><p>This one’s Mt Everest:</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2010/11/P1020104.jpg alt="Mt Everest">
</p><p>Unbelievably just as we left Sandakphu to make our descent around 8am the clouds also descended and covered the mountains rapidly. It was as though they’d never been there.</p><p>We were headed for Rimbik at 2100m and 20km away so it was walking solidly downhill. As we moved away from the Nepalese border and downwards the landscape changed frequently. Wooded areas almost Forest of Dean like and then dense bamboo bushes 10 feet tall each side (we kept out eyes peeled for red panda but none in sight) back to huge trees and jungle-like palms with rivers, rapids and waterfalls. Then openness across a huge valley with remains of a forest fire from ‘88 and further down to agricultural land.</p><p>First chai of the day was had at Gurdum (2300m), 3hours after we left Sandakphu so we were gasping. Gurdum was so pretty. Just a few houses on the side of a hill painted blue and green. With fuchsias and chrysanthemums and countless other flowers & herbs growing in pots lined up alongside the buildings. It was kind of like Calamity Jane’s house after “a woman’s touch”.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2010/11/P1020164.jpg alt=P1020164>
</p><p>Lunch was at Goparma Lodge in Shrikhola (1900m) and we got to choose what we wanted to eat! No rice for us :) The lodge was on the riverside so Matt was off jumping onto rocks to capture the perfect pic of blurred water.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_5999.jpg alt=IMG_5999>
</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_6025.jpg alt=IMG_6025>
 </p><p>We left Shrikola across a dubious bridge and sadly passed a sick horse at the side of the track. It was awful to see it lying there struggling to get up. We have seen too many animals that have died or are about to. I guess if people can’t afford to buy themselves medicine they can’t do it for their animals. This idyllic place was also marred by the rubbish we saw at the side of the river. It seems all waste ends up in the water here. Such a shame.</p><p>The rest of the route to Rimbik was on more of a road which wound around the hills where we passed donkeys and horses carrying goods and saw many houses built of stilts. An old woman was sat on a pile of granite stones breaking more rocks and further along men were laying new tarmac using what looked like the same kind of rocks – a lot of hard manual labour.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/travels-wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_6045.jpg alt="Laying a road">
</p><p> </p><p>Reaching the lodge at Rimbik just after 4pm was a relief after a full day’s walking downhill in good weather and only one chai since breakfast. We were getting withdrawal symptoms. The lodge had a view of Sikkim to the north-east and Darjeeling to the south-east and a shower with hot water. Lush.</p><p>The only downside this time were the paper-thin walls between us and the pissed honeymoon couple in the room next door. Indians aren’t known for being quiet and there were far too many noises coming from their room than we would have liked to hear. Especially when the guy ended up being very ill from drinking too much. Ugh!</p><p>Day 5 – We were planning on a lie-in as the jeep wasn’t coming til 8:30 but the beautiful sunrise together with our mousey neighbours leaving at 6am we were up and having brekkie by 7:30am. A first for us. Halfway through our toast at 7:50 the guide comes into the cafe and says the jeep is here we have to leave!  Why change the habit of a lifetime?</p><p>4 hours later and we’re back in Darjeeling. As I get out the car I realise I can hardly walk. My quads are seized up and I’m walking around like John Wayne again. Matt isn’t much better. Seems we’ve both turned into old people after 6 weeks of no exercise. Good job we did the beginner’s trek.</p></div><footer class=post-footer>
