We were under no illusion that we’d get that ferry when we landed. But the information desk woman at the airport plus the taxi driver assured us we could make it. At 13:58 we were running across the jetty towards the 14:00 ferry laden down with backpacks waving at a large ferry in the dock. They were just about to leave. As we got to the door (knackered) the guys asked for our ticket. Hmmm didn’t have one of those. So no ferry til next morning at 6am. I was pretty peed off as we’d run for it and there was no way we could have got that ferry. Especially now knowing that it takes at least 45mins to get tickets due to the once again faff of a system of getting forms off one guy who only hands them out when he feels like it, deciphering what needs to be filled in, then queuing forever whilst the staff take hours to do the one and only job they need to do. Book a ferry ticket.\nWe spent one night in Port Blair in a nice guest house called Aashiaanaa, had dinner with a couple of Aussies Karim \u0026 Annie and got our 9am ferry to Havelock with no problems. So it worked out well in the end. And we had great seats. We went for “chair” class as had no idea what anything was. As we boarded we were ushered past everyone else going into the main cabin, into a side cabin where there were 7 comfy chairs like on a plane with aircon and one porthole. There were 3 other people apart from us so we felt pretty posh. Very bizarre.\n In Havelock we have a 8ft x 10ft hut consisting of a double bed with mosquito net, a sideboard, a ceiling fan, a lean-to ensuite at the back (painted pink) and a porch at the front. One lattice window, no glass. Plus one door, painted pink. Both window and door are adorned with green Disney-motif curtains – not-quite-the-real-McCoy Mickey Mouse and Donald Ducks cover them.\nThe hut is less than 100m from a small sandy beach and the blue blue sea. Lush.\nFirst few days, bought a hammock, found 2 trees on the beach, laid and read in said hammock with calm relaxing waves in the background.\nHired a moped, neither of us had been on one before. Matt being main driver, me back-seat driver made our way along 12km of dimpley bumpy roads surrounded by rice paddies and jungle across to the North West side of the island to Radha Nagar beach to watch the sun set. The return journey was more interesting with it being pitch black and raining. Made it back alive.\nStarted a PADI Open Water diving course on Tuesday with Dive India and did our first ever dive on Wednesday. Neither of us ever yearned for diving but as we were on an island with good diving we thought we’d give it a go. How do the American’s say it? Awesome.\nOn our 2nd dive we saw a turtle. A real-life sea turtle (a hawskbill) which was about half the size of me. Wow. Plus Nemo and his babies popped out of some sea anemones. The Longfin Bannerfish were also a favourite of mine. Also saw shoals of baby barracuda (we’d eaten a barbequed adult barracuda for our dinner the night before).\nToday we had our 3rd and 4th dives which included a 4-year old shipwreck. Eerie but very cool. So many fish inside just bobbing side to side like some kind of ritualistic dancing. The best dive was the last one along the side of what was called “The Wall” which is a huge reef that drops down almost vertically about 55metres. We went down to 18m. There were so many shoals of different fish of all sizes. A lionfish covered with tentacles, large parrotfish with huge foreheads, an electric clam sparking away in it’s cubby-hole, a huge thick moray eel entangled in the reef where you could see glimpses of its long grey body and its head just poking out with it’s beavis and butthead jaw moving slowly up and down.\nWe couldn’t believe that so much life is going on just below the surface of the ocean. It’s fantastic. And whilst above water the winds were blowing and the current was strong, below the visibility was still good and it felt like another world. Very dream-like.\nFingers-crossed we pass the exam tomorrow so we’ll be qualified and so Matt can take a camera down and start snapping. He spotted their G10 in its underwater casing earlier and now can’t wait to get his hands on it and get into some underwater photography.\nI just want to get back to the Full Moon cafe next to Dive India so we can have more roast chicken and excellent mashed potato. That’s the closest taste to home we’ve had since being in India. Plus homemade lemonade with fresh mint. Yum. The place is a really lovely chilled out place which I think it has something to do with the New Zealand girl who manages it. So many restaurants and hotels etc in India are run by men only and they just don’t get how a few nice touches here and there make a place so much more. Like all food being served on a banana leaf on a plate. It’s a lovely idea.\n","wordCount":"963","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2010-11-15T15:58:31Z","dateModified":"2010-11-15T15:58:31Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"karen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/15/days-45-to-52-thursday-28th-october-to-thursday-4th-november-andaman-islands/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Matt Burns","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mattburns.co.uk/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mattburns.co.uk accesskey=h title="Matt Burns (Alt + H)">Matt Burns</a>
