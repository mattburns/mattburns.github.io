```
var browserIsSupported = !!window.FileReader && Modernizr.draganddrop;
```

  Iâ€™ve tested this in Firefox 3.6, Chrome 10, IE8, Safari 5 and Opera 11. The only browsers from that list to support FileReader from the File API and the drag and drop events are FF and Chrome.

  Letâ€™s hope the other catch up soonâ€¦
