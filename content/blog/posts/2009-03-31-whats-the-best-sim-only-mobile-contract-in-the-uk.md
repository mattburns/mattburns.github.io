OK, I know, it’s a bit of a silly question because everyone has different needs, but these are mine:

  * **1 month rolling contract** — I don’t want to be stuck with the contract for 12 months
  * **Keep my number** — I rummaged through the boxes in a BTCellnet shop years ago to get my number and I’m going to keep it
  * **Unlimited internet** — Well, a fair usage of at least 1GB, and I don’t want to get charged if I go over, I just want a warning
  * **Some free minutes** — To all networks of course
  * **Some free texts**
  * **£25 per month or less**

So far, the best I’ve found is the [solo-20 plan][1] at T-Mobile:

  * **1 month rolling contract**
  * **Keep my number  
** 
  * **Unlimited internet** — Fair usage of 1GB
  * **600 minutes to all networks**
  * **Unlimited texts**
  * **£20 per month**

If you think you’ve found a better plan that meets my minimum requirements, or this deal is no longer available, add a comment and I’ll update this post.

**Update December 2012**: This solo-20 plan is no longer available. This was pointed out to me by a commenter linking to <http://www.comparisim.co.uk/>. I thought, oh great, another spammer (like many of the comments) but the site actually looks pretty good. I also recommend <http://www.billmonitor.com/>. Personally I’m on a normal contract now (this post is old) but please post any good deals in the comments for others to find.

Cheers!
