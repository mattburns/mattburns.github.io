At the end of April [I set myself the challenge][1] of gaining a stone in weight and running a 5km race 2.5 minutes faster.

I ran the same race on Tuesday in 19:15, painfully close to my speed target of 19 minutes. However, I also weighed myself again but have actually lost a pound.

Gah!

Must try harderâ€¦
