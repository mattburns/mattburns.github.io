Fancy a running challenge around Bristol that’ll test your legs and your navigation? All you have to do is touch both Cabot Tower and Troopers Hill Tower (er, chimney) and finish where you started.

Cabot Tower

## The rules are pretty simple:

  1. You have to touch both Cabot Tower and Troopers Hill Tower. Any order.
  2. You must start and finish at the same place (of your choice).
  3. No pausing of your watch (for traffic etc.).

If you take on the challenge, let me know in the comments and I’ll add your results to the table.
