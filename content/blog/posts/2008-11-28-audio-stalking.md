I’m just writting this as a holding place for funny things I overhear. Little bits of someone else’s conversation caught out of context. I hope this is just the beginning or a lifelong reel of quotes that I append to as funny things enter my ears from the mouths of unaware passers-by.

I’m starting it because I just heard:

> “How did it survive being cooked in a flapjack”

I have no idea what she was talking about, and to be honest, I don’t want to know. It’s funnier left to the imagination.
