Bristol have been trialling a bike rental scheme for about a year and I had high hopes for it. I paid my £20 in support of the scheme even though there were no bike stations in the places I needed them. I feel if there were more bikes and more stations it would have been ideal. (see [my comment][1] from back then…).

Unfortunately, they’ve decided to end the scheme deeming it unsuccessful:

I’m gutted 🙁
