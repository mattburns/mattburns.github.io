**Problem:**

wmv file looks squashed when played in VLC or when uploaded to youtube but looks fine when played in windows media player

**Solution:**

You can change the aspect ratio of a wmv file without re-encoding it with [vmarchanger][1]

Ok, hopefully you just searched for this and you’re now sorted, but here’s some background on my problem in case it helps.

I made [a small video][2] (640×480 50fps) on my [7D][3] and wanted to slap it on [youtube][4]. I didn’t have any video editing software so grabbed Windows Live Movie Maker. After exporting the video file I found it plays in the wrong aspect ratio in all players but WMP. The app that fixed it was written by this crypto fellow [over here][5]. Thanks Crypto!

The real cause of the problem?

I didn’t use a mac.
