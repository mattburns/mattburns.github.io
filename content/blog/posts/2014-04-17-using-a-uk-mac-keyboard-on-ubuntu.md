If you’re using a UK edition usb keyboard with Ubuntu, you may be swearing every time you want a relatively common characters like £, # or |.

I’ve been suffering with a poorly mapped keyboard for months. I’ve no idea why, I just assumed I must have tried when I installed the OS and deemed it impossible. Anyway, I’m an idiot because it’s really easy.

Open up your keyboard settings and pick “Layout Settings”:

Click the little “+” to add a new input source:

Select “English (UK, Macintosh)”:

Move it to the top of your list and BOSH! You’re done.

_(**Warning**: You may still swear looking for the # key because it’s not printed on the keyboard like it is on a macbook. It’s alt-3)_
