Facebook have broken its messenger feature into its own app. Lots of people [freaked out][1] thinking Facebook wanted to use it to spy on them as it requires excessive permissions etc. In reality, [it probably needs all those permissions][2], I don’t really care about that, privacy died years ago. What bothers me is that people use it instead of emailing me. I strongly prefer email. It’s searchable and owned by me. I know I’m swimming against the tide a bit, but I’m clinging on to email for as long as possible.

Anyway, **I don’t have the Messenger app installed on my phone**, and nor does Karen but she saw this on her phone yesterday:

# Hang on… WTF!

I’m not using the messenger app, but facebook are showing my adorable trustworthy face to her as a recommendation. Admittedly I occasionally use the messenger feature on the website when I have to, but I have never installed or used the app.

Seriously facebook, _what are you playing at_?
