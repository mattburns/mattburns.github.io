If you’re trying to update your LG mobile (I’m doing my LG Arena KM900) you will be taken to [a page](http://www.lg.com/uk/support/product/support-product-profile-mobile-redux.jsp?customerModelCode=KM900&initialTab=documents&targetPage=support-product-profile#p) that tells you to install the WINDOWS USB Driver, whatever that is.

At time of writing, that link doesn’t work.

Don’t worry, just go ahead and click “Software Update” as there is the option to install the usb driver there. If you also need the PC Suite, I found a copy [here][1].
