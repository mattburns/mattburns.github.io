Googleâ€™s friendly little [chromecast][1] has some [great background images][2].

If you want to download all of those images so you can have a nice high quality screen saver on your laptop/mobile etc. just do this:

    git clone -b patch-1 https://github.com/mattburns/chromecast-backgrounds.git
    cd chromecast-backgrounds/
    npm install lodash q request nopt chalk
    node cli.js --download=images --size=1024 --load=backgrounds.json

Change the size from 1024 to whatever maximum size you want to download.

I had to tweak the source from [this project on github][3]. Hopefully my fork will get folded in.
