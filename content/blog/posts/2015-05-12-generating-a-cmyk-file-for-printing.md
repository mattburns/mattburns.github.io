So you want to print something (like a banner) but the printers have asked for it to be int the CMYK colorspace? Well we could argue about how to spell colour or [whether CMYK is a colorspace][1] at all. But I canâ€™t be bothered, letâ€™s just cut and paste this command which is what I came up with after a morning of hackingâ€¦

```
convert -resize 9520 -density 300 rgb_input.pdfÂ +profile icm -profile sRGB_IEC61966-2-1_black_scaled.icc -profile SWOP2006_Coated3v2.icc -quality 85 cmyk_output.jpeg
```

Importantly, rgb_input.pdf was exported with [scribus][2] using the output mode for screen.

Here are some dependencies for you macboy:

```
brew install ghostscript
brew install imagemagick --with-little-cms
brew cask install xquartz
brew cask install inkscape
brew cask install scribus
```

Youâ€™ll find ICC profiles [here][3].

Yes, this is another blog just for my personal notes ðŸ˜‰

**UPDATE** for [moo.com][4] users:

[Moo suggest][5] you upload media with the â€˜Coated FOGRA39â€™ ICC profile. You can find it in [this zip file here][6]. Moo also have some [suggested resolutions for uploaded media][7] although I just multiplied those up a bit to make sure the quality was extra high just in case.

```
convert -resize 6192 -density 600 rgb_input.pdf +profile icm -profile sRGB_v4_ICC_preference.icc -profile CoatedFOGRA39.icc -quality 85 cmyk_output.jpeg
```
