Ok, I just bought a 4K display, whoop!

I knew when I bought it that neither my [late-2012 Retina Macbook Pro][1], or my Ubuntu desktop machine would actually drive the monitor at 4K because they both rely on Intelâ€™s HD4000 graphics which is built into their Ivy bridge CPUs. I did however expect to get at least 2560Ã—1440 (if only at 30Hz) which is fine by me, and then Iâ€™m ready when I next upgradeâ€¦

## OSX

Unfortunately, I initially couldnâ€™t get the Macbook to run at anything above 1080p (which looks horrible) (as you can see from [my stackexchange question][2]).

I then managed to get full 3840Ã—2160 @30Hz using mini-displayport and an app called SwitchResX. Here are my custom settings, you need to reboot the machine to apply them:

As a word of warning, this does make things eye-bleedingly small. (Pretty cool though)

Personally, I found the â€˜scaledâ€™ resolution of 1920Ã—1200 to be the best for me because it uses HiDPI to give you that retina feel youâ€™re used to. It will look like 1920Ã—1200 but actually use more pixels to paint it. Here are the settings:

This is much more sensible (although I would like it smaller to be honest):

The downside is that you lose some of the screen down the sides. Let me know if you have any better suggestions.

If you find the colors going a bit funny, I used SwitchResX to change the color profile to sRGB IEC61966-2.1 like this:

## Ubuntu

[Thanks to Linus himself][3], I was able to get 2560Ã—1440 working on Ubuntu:

`xrandr --newmode 2560x1440_30.00 146.27 2560 2680 2944 3328 1440 1441 1444 1465 -HSync +Vsync<br />
xrandr --addmode HDMI2 "2560x1440_30.00"<br />
xrandr --output HDMI2 --mode "2560x1440_30.00"`

If you make any mistakes, you can remove them with:  
`xrandr --delmode HDMI2 "2560x1440_30.00"<br />
xrandr --rmmode 2560x1440_30.00`

That will have to do for now although I may buy another graphics card for the Ubuntu machine, suggestions welcome ðŸ™‚
