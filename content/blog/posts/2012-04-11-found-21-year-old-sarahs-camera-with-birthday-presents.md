This is an appeal to anyone who may know a 21 year old Sarah (born April 6th, 1991) in Windsor, UK. Her camera and other precious items have been found and we want to get them back to her.

> Sarah a celebrated her 21st birthday on friday 6th april. she got picked up by a taxi in windsor on sat morning. a bag containing a pink floral photo album celebrating her life upto her 21st birthday, camera, scarf and other things were left. please help me locate this young lady. precious photos, im sure she would want back

People are losing cameras all the time and thankfully there are plenty of nice people out there that find them and are happy to give them back. There are many more stories like these on the lost and found map over on [stolencamerafinder.com][1].
