Looking to build a new PC? Want to build one that will play nicely with Windows or Linux or could even be a [Hackintosh][1]? Making sure you choose the right combination of components is important and a pain to research. If youâ€™re feeling lazy, hereâ€™s my shopping list for the machine I built that Iâ€™m using right now.

By the way, itâ€™s faaaaaast ðŸ˜‰

CPU â€“ [Intel Ivy Bridge (i5-3570K)][2]Â â€“ Â£169  
SSD â€“ [SanDisk 120GB (SDSSDX)][3]Â â€“ Â£73  
HDD â€“ [Seagate 1TB (ST31000524AS)][4]Â â€“ Â£59  
RAM â€“ [Corsair 4x4GB (CMZ16GX3M4A1600C9B)][5]Â â€“ Â£67  
DVD â€“ [Sony (AD-7280S-0B)][6]Â â€“ Â£17  
PSU â€“ [Corsair (CX430V2)][7]Â â€“ Â£34  
Case â€“ [Corsair (Carbide 400R)][8]Â â€“ Â£79  
Motherboard â€“ [Gigabyte (Z77-DS3H)][9] â€“ Â£68

# Total price â€“ **Â£566**

Iâ€™ve been using this machine for a couple of months now and it is a pleasure to use. Here are some notes:

  * It boots into Ubuntu in about 10 seconds.
  * Iâ€™ve not overclocked my build, because itâ€™s already faster than me anyway.
  * Donâ€™t skip the SSD, itâ€™s essential for a fast machine!
  * It supports mSATA, but donâ€™t be tempted, just stick with a separate SSD. Keep your OS and apps on the SSD, and your files on the HDD.
  * Iâ€™m using the stock CPU fan and it works well and is quiet.
  * The case is pretty big. I prefer that but a much smaller one would be fine.
  * I donâ€™t play games so this build doesnâ€™t have a graphics card. The onboard graphics are more than good enough for me (no problems with HD video etc.). No doubt Iâ€™ll buy one in a year or two when I need to drive a 50" retina display ðŸ˜‰
  * View all the parts in [this Amazon wish list][10].
  * You donâ€™t need any special brackets for the SSD, this case already has mounting screws for it.
  * You donâ€™t need any thermal paste, it all just clicks together.
