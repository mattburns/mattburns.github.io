Canon have just released the [7D][1] and although I can’t really afford it, I have to have one!

The price difference between UK and US is pretty crazy. Here, [my favourite camera shop][2] are selling body only for £1,399. £300 less than Canon’s SRP. In New York’s [B&H store][3] you can pick it up for $1,699 (~£1,014).

As luck would have it, I’m going to NY this weekend so if I’m going to buy one, now’s the time to decide.

I saw some [people on flickr discussing][4] whether or not it was worth it, or whether you could get it through customs and so I decided to call them myself. I rang the [VAT, Customs and Excise helpline][5] and was told that it being a digital camera, it was not liable for import duty and I would only have to pay VAT (currently @ 15%). I would just declare it on arrival in the UK by going down [the red channel][6].

I think I can get the US sales tax (~8.25% ?) knocked off the camera when I buy it if I show them my passport and tell them I’m taking it home, but I’m not sure about that. Please comment if you know…

**UPDATE**: I contacted them about sales tax:

> _Purchases in our store (and all stores in NYC) are subject to an 8.875% local sales tax. This tax is not a VAT, and cannot be recovered by non-USA visitors when returning home. All prices are listed before sales tax._

This brings the total to $1,850 (£1106), it means I can still buy the 7D for about £1,270 when you add the VAT. A saving of £130.

However, I’m also not sure the Canon warranty covers me outside the US.

**UPDATE:** I contacted them about warranty too:

> _The warranty on this product is only good inside the USA. We offer the SageMax Protection Plan which is good for worldwide warranty and accidental damage protection…_

What would you do?
