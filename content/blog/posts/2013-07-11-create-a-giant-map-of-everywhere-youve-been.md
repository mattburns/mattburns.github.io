Google have just announced that [theyâ€™re giving Latitude the boot][1]. Not in the distant future but next monthÂ (August 9th). Iâ€™m gutted as I was just getting used to relying on its awesomeness. At first I panicked because Iâ€™ve been using the [Location History][2] feature to log my location for the past 3 years. Thankfully, [that feature is spared the chop][3] (well, for now at least).

If you have also been using it to log your location then youâ€™ll be glad to hear you canÂ [download your location history][4]. Unfortunately, once downloaded, there isnâ€™t an easy way to view the history so I decided to write something. Here is the output image of everywhere Iâ€™ve been in the last 3 years (click through for a glorious [high-res version][5]):

[![Map of where I've been for 3 years](/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/GPS_tracking_points.jpg) ][5]

It includes some time I spent travelling (ahhâ€¦ good timesâ€¦) so Iâ€™ll print a poster to hang on the wall.

There may be whole continents Iâ€™ve not been near but if you zoom in, youâ€™ll see Iâ€™ve got Bristol pretty well covered ðŸ˜‰

## Want a map of everywhere youâ€™ve been?

Currently the process is a fiddly manual one. If itâ€™s something youâ€™d pay for, let me know in the comments and if thereâ€™s enough interest Iâ€™ll add it as a product on my photo-printing site: [OddPrints][6].
