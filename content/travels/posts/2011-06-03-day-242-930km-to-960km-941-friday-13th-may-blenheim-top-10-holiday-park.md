Wake up in the Cork & Keg carpark with rain battering on the windows. Darn it. No wine tour for us today.

We go back to Blenheim, find a powered campsite next to a river, invest in wifi and hole up for the day working on [SCF][1]. 

People are still tweeting about it 17 days after the initial blogging and it’s appearing on so many different websites and in many different languages. Even some top websites have now mentioned it. Engadget, Reuters, … [Matt][2]’s famous again. ;)

We step out for half hour to get some fresh air and share a Double-down burger from KFC. The controversial no-bun burger kicking up a stink in NZ. It has 540 calories and annoyingly tasted pretty good.
