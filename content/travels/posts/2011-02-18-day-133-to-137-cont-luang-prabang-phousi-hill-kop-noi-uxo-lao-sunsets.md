Whilst I spent my mornings at Big Brother Mouse, Matt concentrated on [stolencamerafinder][1]&nbsp; (check it out!). We almost fell into a normal routine. We’d both be up before 8am, ready to go get a breakfast baguette & a strong Lao coffee or Jasmine tea from the local Lao ladies. Matt would have chicken and I would go for Lao-style which is tofu, omelette and some brown hairy stuff. 

Then we’d part ways and I’d go on my 10 min walk through the town or the morning market to Big Brother Mouse and Matt would go back to the guest house and get coding. He met a Chinese guy there who was also working. He’d been travelling around Asia for 2 years doing research on trees and their effect on agriculture.

After Big Brother Mouse I would try to spend a bit more time away from the room to give Matt time to work on SCF in peace. I found the Kop Noi shop which sells locally made textiles and toiletries. They were quite expensive so I only thought I’d spend a few minutes there. When I was about to leave the guy working there pointed upstairs to the gallery. I wandered upstairs and found the fascinating [Stay Another Day][2] exhibition all about Luang Prabang and life in Laos. It was interesting to find out about life in Laos. The different tribes Hmong & Khmu that live here at different levels in the hills. How they make pure silk by hand in a long process from the silk worms to dyeing to weaving and the finished product.&nbsp; The different teas made across the country. The mulberry green tea only grown in Vang Vieng, smoked black tea in North Laos and green and golden teas in Paksong. Apparently Lao tea is drunk as a “chaser” to coffee. An hour must have passed before I left.&nbsp; 

We would meet for lunch at 13:00 and find some noodle soup or fried noodles at a local restaurant. In the afternoon I’d usually go for another wander or bug Matt enough to go with me.

Most evenings we’d watch the sun set then eat at one of the fairy-light lit restaurants along the river. Although 2 nights in a row we succumbed to the Scandinavian pizza parlour and another night we ate at the night market buffet. A long narrow lane of food stalls where you have a plate of whatever you want (noodles, rice, veggies) for 10,000kip and sit along benches with the rest of the rabble.

A particular restaurant became a favourite due to the alternative dishes on offer. Lao sausage served with chilly dip and peanuts and spicy marinated Lao beef on a bed of lettuce were good mains after a starter of fried Mekong river weed.

One afternoon I dragged Matt away from the laptop to venture up Phousi hill smack in the centre of Luang Prabang. It’s a knackering 100m climb up a twisting staircase and at the top you have almost 360° panoramic views over Luang Prabang, the Mekong river and the hills beyond. It’s breathtaking but I have to say a tad over-popular. Could hardly see the sunset for the amount of people & cameras waving around. Still worth the effort and the wander down the other side was just as rewarding as there are many buddha statues on the route down.

Through Kop Noi I found out about the [UXO Lao][9] exhibition which explains about the unexploded ordnance in Laos from American cluster bombs that bombarded the country in the 60s and 70s. It was a small room but what it displayed was shocking.&nbsp; Over 2 tonnes of bombs were dropped during that time and approx 8 million bombs remained after the war. Since then many people in Laos have been blown up by them and at least one person every day is maimed or killed. I found it eerie being the only visitor at that time and I saw that only one other person had signed the visitor book that day. Such a shame for an organisation that needs more exposure and more donations. I tried to ask if the American government are paying for the clean-up but the lady there couldn’t understand my question. If they’re not they should be. 

On our last full day in Luang Prabang we hired bikes and cycled around the town following the rivers. We paid to cross a bamboo bridge to a bar overlooking the mouth of the Nam Tha flowing into the Mekong.

Matt spotted Sylvester the snake sunning himself as we walked back along the overgrown pathway to our bikes:<img title="IMG_2093" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: block; border-left-width: 0px; float: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-right-width: 0px" height="427" alt="IMG_2093" src="http://www.mattburns.co.uk/travels/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMG_2093_thumb.jpg" width="640" border="0" />&nbsp;

Other notable things in Luang Prabang:

Morning market – this is bustling from early morning with locals buying an array of unusual items. One morning I saw a woman with a bowl of live frogs. She was trying to get one of them out from under the net which covered them without letting any others escape. They were constantly jumping up and down head-butting the net as she pulled one out and popped him into a plastic bag. Another lady sorted through a mountain of snails whilst her neighbour sits with bowls of water being pumped full of freshwater from hosepipes overflowing with different types of live fish. 

The amount of fresh herbs, unusual fruits and vegetables are a sight for sore eyes. Especially the vibrant cerise dragonfruit (which were delicious fresh, not so interesting as a fruit shake). I would have taken a photo but was put off by the “tours” of westerners being guided through the market with their Nikons and Canons pointing everywhere. 

Night market – from 5pm the main street is closed to traffic and it is transformed into a tented marketplace with two alleyways barely 2 people wide and filled with stall after stall after stall selling bright bed coverings, wall hangings, lampshades, scarves, jewellery and handbags. Now and then is something slightly different such as a seller of Lao Lao whiskey containing snakes and scorpions or a Big Brother Mouse stand. But most of it is the same. Every evening hoards of women come with their blue and red striped plastic bags carrying their wares. Many arrive on mopeds, others pile out of the back of a truck. Everything is meticulously laid out on their spot and put away again a few hours later. There are so many stalls it takes 20minutes to walk 200metres.

Temples – are majestic and all over town and every morning at 4 or 5am the monks bang the temple drums.

The book exchange – raising money for a local orphanage is a good cause. Either swap a book & pay 20,000 kip or buy one of the more popular ones. We were happy to donate to buy a book (which happened to be the quite dire The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). It’s a shame the woman running it in her grand house in the most expensive part of Luang Prabang couldn’t have been a little more pleasant else I wouldn’t have felt so reluctant to give to the charity. We felt that she seemed to spend most of her time making signs to put people off rather than helping the orphanage. One sign said something like “Beware of the Dog. If you try to pat the dog or leave the premises she may bite. You have been warned. We accept no responsibility.” Plus “If you steal you are stealing from the children.” And “These books over here are for the owner to read first. These are not for exchange. Only when the owner decides she is finished with the book will these books be made available for swapping”. Um excuse me? If I donate a book I expect it to go straight on the shelf. Not to be used by the owner first. It winds I right up.

To end on a much more positive note we loved Luang Prabang. It is the most chilled place we have been to so far on our travels. It may be a little pretentious and there are possibly too many outsiders who have set up business here but it is a beautiful place with friendly people and we could have stayed indefinitely. Definitely a recommendation to anyone thinking of coming to SE Asia.
