Today is a sad day. It’s the penultimate day of our travels. Where has the time gone?

Luckily we’re too exhausted to be that sad. Not that exhausted, however, to look around the huge camera store just across from Tokyo Bus Station. Matt had gone from one dream to another.

We knew if we headed back to K’s House it would be too early to check in so decided to do some last minute sightseeing. We hadn’t seen the famous Shibuya [pedestrian crossing][1], or scramble, as I have just found out it is called.

Or the hip shopping street [Takeshita][3] in Harajuku with the trendy shops for teens as it is described in the LP.

And more Takoyaki had to be eaten before we left Japan of course. Where in Britain can we possibly find balls of octopus covered in cheese?

On the route back to the third and final stay at K’s House Tokyo, we spotted an animated noodle bowl, with chopsticks bobbing up and down.

Hey we hadn’t slept for 36 hours so we were easily amused. Also due to this fact, we had to spend a couple of hours in the hotel snoozing to have some kind of chance of enjoying the last evening of our dream.

Problem is 318 days have passed since that day** and I can barely remember what we did that evening. I know we ended up back at the Shibuya crossing – same place twice in one day in the whole of Tokyo is quite a challenge – and finding food of some sort. Was it Tempura? Or sushi? Or teppanaki? Who knows? Just that it was good and topped off with one of the most expensive half pints of lager we’ve ever had due to a “seating service” of 500Y in the bar we happened upon. Still it was worth it. Look how happy & hairy we are!

_*Note: The first half of this post was written on 29th July 2011. The second half was written extremely slowly over the period since the last blog post. Let it not be said that I never finish anything._

_** this is pure coincidence that I am finishing day 318, 318 days after the occasion. I had no idea. That has hit me hard. That we have been back in the UK for the same length of time as our whole trip minus 1 day. Time is such a weird and wonderful thing. You can fit so much into it if you really try and nothing much if you stop trying._
