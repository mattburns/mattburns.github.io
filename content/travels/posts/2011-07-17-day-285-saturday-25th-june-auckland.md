We’d quite like to leave tomorrow now. But flights are cancelled again all day. So we’re now on a Monday flight.

This is a slight pain as it means 4 nights in Auckland. Qantas will only pay for 3 so we have to move somewhere cheaper. 

We don’t want to leave Hotel deBrett!

Being in limbo waiting to see if our flights are on or off has meant being completely lazy in Auckland and just playing the waiting game. So no interesting photos and nothing else to report today.
