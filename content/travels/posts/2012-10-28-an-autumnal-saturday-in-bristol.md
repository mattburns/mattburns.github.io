Blue skies & sunshine with a slight breeze welcomed us as we stepped out of the front door. 

[Ashton Court 10k][1]. Not me of course. Just Matt. A low key event with the Heart FM guys trying their best to get the “crowds” geared up for cheering the home-coming runners. Especially as the Heart FM Angels were nowhere to be seen. The last time I’d seen them was at the 5k marker halfway up the hill bouncing around with their sparkly pom poms. So I did my best cheerleading impression minus pompoms and shouted and clapped the runners at the finish line. Proudly, Matt came 11th out of 667 with a time of 42:34. 

I love Twitter. You find out so much stuff that is going on. I spotted that [@Grillstock][2], that we loved for bar-b-q food fest & chilli eating this summer, are now down in [St Nick’s Market][3]. So that was lunch sorted – a huge portion of pulled pork & ‘slaw in a bun. We sat on the steps of the old Lloyds building by Castle Park, soaking up the crisp sun, watching the bmx crowd trying out their tricks, with a glistening river and Bristol Bridge as their backdrop. 

[Guy Fawkes][4] near [St Nick’s market][5] by the lovely Emily. I rarely get a haircut. I always find excuses for not having time. But when I do get round to it I love it because I come out looking like a different person. 

Our intention was to go shopping in Cabot Circus but the harbourside was a-calling on such a beautiful day. 

Warming cup of Latte sat on a blue leather sofa outside [No.1 Harbourside][6] watching the world go by. Living and un-dead. As people with blood and guts hanging out and chainsaws for arms wandered by on their way to the [Day of the Dead Festival][7]. Topped off nicely with a double chocolate brownie from the lovely lady in the blue-bobble hat freezing her fingertips off at the wonderful [Harbour Market][8].

Passing through the always fabulous Queens Square with the trees in optimum autumnal bloom, the fixies were out in droves ready for the [Fixed ‘n’ Chips][9] challenge. I’d heard about this earlier in the week on [Bristol Culture][10] – apparently you get a point for each fish & chip shop visited in Bristol plus 5 bonus points for eating a battered sausage. The range of Fixies was incredible – even ones carved from wood.

We were to continue straight to Cabot, but were halted by the sounds of a random band coming from [The Old Duke][11]. Couldn’t resist a half-pint of [Bath Ales Gem][12] and a mini jig before going full-circle back to our bikes by St Nicks. 

Again we were distracted from our original destination by a PA system in Castle Park and our diversion took us to a record-breaking attempt for the most [dancing zombies][13] in the same place at the same time??!! 

We finally ended up in Cabot Circus at 5pm. Love Bristol.
