Groundhog day.

Woke up at the same campsite, did another 10 minute run and sat outside the library using the free wifi. What an exciting life we are leading.

Better than working.

[SCF](https://www.stolencamerafinder.com/) is really taking off and Matt has had more journalists contacting him. One from the BBC online Technology section today. Yesterday it was the Guardian newspaper. And to top it off he was on BBC Lincolnshire last night so we listened to the clip they’d sent him and laughed and learned a few things about radio shows :). To be fair he had been in a hotel room in Bangkok at the time with no time to prepare.

I am now first response helpdesk whilst Matt does the PR.

The journey from Hanmer Springs to Kaikoura was breathtaking. They say New Zealand can have four seasons in one day. Today was one of those days. Fog, cloud, sunshine, blue skies, fog.

Mustn’t forget the deer and the goats.

Matt promptly legged it back to the van when the goats started advancing…

Pulled up on the side of a road for another timelapse opportunity and to throw together some sarnies for lunch whilst the camera did its stuff. Sat in the back of our campervan it made me think of the holidays my mum described to me of when she was a young girl. The whole family, mum & dad & 6 kids would pile into the car with the caravan on tow to head to the seaside and stop in a layby to have a full feast with china plates, cups & saucers. Those were the days.

Had a choice of two freebie DOC campsites tonight. The one closest to Kaikoura is 6km up a gravel track along the Puhi Puhi river. It is probably beautiful in good weather but the fog had descended so the mountains were hardly visible and we decided to move to the next campsite. Except we’d pulled up on the grass and got bogged down in mud. My fault. I’d said go forward when Matt wanted to go backwards. There we were wheels spinning and throwing up mud. It took 30 mins to get out after Matt’s good idea of padding it with sticks & gravels and flooring it. I thought we’d be stuck there all night.

So we’re now at the 2nd choice further away from Kaikoura but we can just about see the sea out the back window and every so often a train comes rumbling by just between us and the coast. Looking forward to the morning light.
