First aftershock felt this morning at the hostel. I was sat checking my email and Matt was coming out of the shower. It felt really surreal. Everything seemed to shudder but you couldn’t put your finger on what moved or even if you moved. The sound was like someone running across a landing with hobnail boots on but we were on the ground floor. The adrenaline pumped for a few minutes afterwards.

Spent the morning walking the perimeter of Christchurch and seeing so much more damage than we’d imagined.

An elderly man passed stopped and asked us where we were from. When we said UK he said Christchurch used to be the most English city in New Zealand and he was sorry that it had nothing to offer tourists now. His eyes were so sad. We can still see what a gorgeous place it was and still is. I’m sure it will be as lovely as before one day.

Another guy pulled up outside our hostel and started chatting to us asking where we were headed next. We had planned to go to Lyttleton but hadn’t realised that was the epicentre of the quake so the main street in the small town is to be pulled down completely. How sad.

_[ 11/05/11 heard on the radio that they need to demolish 900 buildings within Christchurch city centre. They started pulling down the TV company building today. It was one we’d seen from a distance as it wasn’t far from Around the World hostel. It was 60 years old. ]_

Picked up van and definitely feel like old people (sorry anyone with a motorhome) but it’s going to be good.

We’ve hired it for 50 days. 50 days of a house on wheels. We’ve gone for the poncy option of having loo/shower & fridge, high enough even Matt has space to stand up straight and lots of power points for laptops for essential [SCF](http://www.stolencamerafinder.com/) work.

Back to domesticity with a kitchen on wheels. A big shop in Countdown supermarket – it’s expensive to eat here! Good job the wine isn’t at £4 a bottle for a New Zealand merlot. Sorted.

Didn’t get out of Christchurch. Only as far as Spencer Beach holiday park. It took us so long to buy food it was getting dark and us being virgin campers needed to make sure we knew how this baby worked in the light. 

Didn’t set the mileage counter either. So this is practice run day. Tomorrow we’re campervanning for real.

Extreme cheese. First proper home-cooked food in the van. Good old-fashioned spag bol & red wine.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/05/P1060146.jpg)
