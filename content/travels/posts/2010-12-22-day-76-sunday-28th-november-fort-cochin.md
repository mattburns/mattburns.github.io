We have left Alleppey, hooray! Matt is on the mend although not 100% so treated ourselves to a taxi from Alleppey to Fort Cochin. A bit extravagant but more predictable than the train or bus when you’re not feeling too well and we just wanted to move on from here as soon as possible. The taxi driver was very sweet. Mentioning Manchester United and David Beckham but not understanding us when we asked “Do you watch a lot of English football?”. He pointed out every temple and church we passed and slowed down at each one. He did almost get us into one of the Kashmir shops near Fort Cochin. It was a good job Matt was paying attention as I just thought he was pointing that out too.

Back at the trusty Elite Hotel. We honestly did try other places to have a change but they were full or too expensive. The guy here is also a really good bloke.

Found a gorgeous olde worlde shop on Princess Street called “Indian Industries “. There were so many good things about it. The owners didn’t hassle us, everything had price stickers so we didn’t have to haggle and it was full to the brim with many interesting things we hadn’t seen anywhere else. The owner explained that his father had opened the shop in 1945 – pre-independence and it had been the only shop on the road until 7&nbsp; years ago. He had seen Fort Kochi change over the years from a sleepy residential place to an extremely touristy town. 25 years ago there were only 2 cars in the neighbourhood. The whole of Princess Street is either souvenir shops or hotels. He can’t see any of the real India left. And he made the same remark as we’d thought – that everyone and their dog has a mobile phone. No matter how poor. The country has been invaded by them.

We bought a couple of things for ourselves and left him sat with his mother in their shop and pondering over what used to be.&nbsp; We really felt for him. And we couldn’t bring ourselves to buy anything from any of the other shops in Kochi.
