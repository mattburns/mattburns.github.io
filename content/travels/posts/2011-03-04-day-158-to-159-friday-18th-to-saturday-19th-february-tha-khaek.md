Tha Khaek is a funny one. There’s not much here but every guesthouse was full on Friday evening. After trying 4 different guesthouses we ended up in the dodgy Khammouane Inter Guest House next door to the Karaoke, with a single bed masquerading as a double bed. I use the word bed in the loosest of terms as the mattress was rock hard and sunken in the middle. There were no curtains on the rails and the wooden shutters were covered by torn mossie nets. It had aircon though. A massive archaic machine was fitted on the ceiling directly above the “bed” which threatened to fall on us in the night. And it had a teeny “SONY” TV and a teeny fridge which were both as old as the hotel. I would say in its heyday it would have been a swanky modern business hotel. But 30 years on without any money spent on it during that time it had become more than a little tired and was overpriced.

Needless to say we hardly slept that night. It wasn’t helped by me feeling ill. We’d had grilled fish on a stick with sticky rice from a street stall for dinner which tasted lovely but later wasn’t so lovely.

Once again we moved guesthouses. A 15 min sweaty walk to the tourist information and we stumbled across Douxan Guest House which had a proper size bed and was more of a home than a hotel. This meant a 15-min extremely sweaty walk with our backpacks from the previous hotel. We were hard and managed it without either of us complaining which makes a change ;)

We intended to take a trip to Kong Lor Cave but for a 1 day tour they wanted to charge us £120. Ridiculous prices. It may have been cheaper if more people wanted to go but we couldn’t justify it and so we’ve canned Tha Khaek and leave tomorrow.

Despite not doing much in Tha Khaek we did find a hidden gem on Saturday night. Whilst sitting at another Mekong riverside restaurant watching another beautiful sunset over Thailand (where tourists jump on boats and come across the Mekong to gawp at Laos and then go back again) we spotted a bar on the river with neon lights. This was the Smile bar which opens at 9pm and after a precarious hike down steep steps to the river you enter a place with the feel of the Thekla in Bristol. A bit dingy and badly laid out but good live music, packed with people and a great atmosphere. With fairy lights thrown in for good measure. I learned how to dance Lao-style that evening by a very drunk Lao guy and some pretty tipsy Lao girls.
