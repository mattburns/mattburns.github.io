Still in hospital but this is definitely the last night and we’re out of here tomorrow morning. Free! Matt is feeling much better & is ecstatic at the thought of leaving. He’s had enough of goop being pumped into his arm and lying down for hours watching TV. 

Another trip to the market for veggies and heard Mary’s Boy Child blasting out of someone’s ghetto blaster. Hearing xmas carols makes me a little homesick. Especially in this heat! As well as veggies managed to acquire laughing cow cheese triangles and bread rolls for random sarnie making.

Saw Anita again for her boiling pot. As it is St Francis day today everything closed early so she was minutes away from closing up for the day. Lovely as she is she still said she’s do the veggies so I stopped to help chop them up (the first bit of “home-cooking” I’ve done in a long time). And whilst they were bubbling away we looked at her daughter’s wedding photos whilst Christmas carols played in the background.

Back at the hospital Nurse Rupa was back for her next 24hr shift. She came in frequently to chat to us about everything she could think of regarding Indian culture and Western culture. Apart from wanting to know what religion we are (and being shocked at the answer – a question we’ve been asked a number of times whilst in India and the answer usually stops all conversation), here are some of her views which were quite an eye-opener to us. Mainly because Rupa is from a younger generation than us – she was 20 years old at most and things that we just don’t see any issue with in our culture are huge dilemmas for her.

  * She wants to marry a foreigner but doesn’t think they would like her because of her skin colour. Marriage between people of different race seemed alien to her. She was really surprised we know couples of all different backgrounds with different skin colour. Yet because she wants to marry a foreigner because she doesn’t like Indian boys as they go after foreign girls in short dresses. She thinks western guys are more loyal and trustworthy. Hmmmm… 
      * Marriage and divorce – you marry once and live with an understanding forever regardless of what happens. Divorce is frowned upon and she was disgusted we know divorced people. 
          * Living with each other before marriage and not with parents . Surprised we lived so far apart from each other and not in same house as our parents. 
              * She would like to work in the UK or America but passports are expensive (2000 rupee which is almost a year’s wages) and she would not get permission from parents to go outside India. If she was male it would be different.</ul> 
            She also kept going on about us getting married and when we get married in India next year she wants an invite :)
            
            I have her address so although she may not be a guest at our never happening wedding at least I can keep in touch with her and see how she’s getting on finding her dream guy.
