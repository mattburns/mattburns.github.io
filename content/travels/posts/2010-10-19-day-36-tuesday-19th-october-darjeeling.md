The sun came out today. Hooray! At 3pm after umming and ahhing and umming some more in our worse than normal indecisive manner, we finally made a decision to go on the trek. At 3.05 as we left the hotel, it started raining. Half hour more of deliberating and we thought sod it lets go. Even if it’s raining its what we have wanted to do the whole time we’ve been in Darjeeling (apart from the toy train of course).

We popped to Footy Cafe to see if we could find the French couple who had planned to go at the same time as us. Instead we found John and Mel, the Frampton Cotterell couple, who had just got back from a 5-day trek. They were shattered and it had rained a lot but they said it was worth it. So it made us feel better about the decision.

On the way to confirm with Somewhere over the Rainbow treks that it was still OK to go at such short notice we spotted the French couple Nicholas and Noeline in another cafe. They had decided to wait a few more days as they have more time than us. Then in Chowrasta (the main square) we bumped into the New Zealand couple whom we’d met in Delhi half-checking in then checking out of Smyle Inn (its a small world here) who hadn’t tried Cake Lady brownies yet but who had heard of her because she’s a fellow New Zealander.&nbsp; So we managed to find out her name after all – its Helen (good name :) )!

Spent the rest of the afternoon looking for hiking boots but although things are cheaper here (North Face boots are about £30-£40) we couldn’t justify buying some for the sake of one trek. So decided to hire some instead. The guy at the Trekking Shop directed us to Trek Mate to hire some. They’re a little manky but they’ll do for 40p per day. We then popped back to the Trekking Shop and found some gators (yep very stylish). He spotted our hired boots and noticed my lace was falling apart so instead of trying to flog me some of his he went off and came back with a lighted candle and proceeded to burn the ends of the lace and fixed them. What a sweetie. Darjeeling is really nothing like India!

So 7am tomorrow we’ll be off up a mountain or two. We’re currently at 2134 metres. The highest we will climb is approx 3600 metres. Wish us luck. 

Back Sunday……
