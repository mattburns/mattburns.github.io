Flight from Port Blair to Chennai was faultless. Kingfisher airlines were excellent. The flight was on time. The bus at Chennai from the plane to the terminal had armchairs & sofas to sit on. I am not kidding. Here I am trying to take a photo of both of us sat in one of the armchairs quickly before anyone sees me and arrests me for breaching airport security. This was embarrassingly the best one out of four attempts!

Chennai was a bit of a disaster. Started off OK. Managed to get the train from the airport to the central train station successfully for the cost of a cup of chai. Had 7hrs to kill til our train so trundled off to left luggage where they refused at first to take it as we had no padlocks on our bags. Firstly how is it possible to padlock a backpack and secondly what’s the bloody point of leaving it in left luggage if they can’t trust their own employees not to steal from unlocked bags. Matt argued with them until they agreed to take them but after 20mins we were back there taking them back. We felt it was asking for our stuff to be tampered with. This meant we had to carry the darn things with us. That set me off in a bad mood and at that point I really wanted to leave India. It was doing my head in. I know it sounds like a trivial thing but this country can really make you go through a rollercoaster of emotions. 

Calmed down and wandered off to George Town as the LP book made it sound interesting. All we could see were metal shop after metal shop after metal shop making or selling anything you could desire made of…metal. Except for one road which was nothing but dental clinics. There were many people lying in the streets in rags.

Then between Chennai Central and George Town amongst the chaos was this rather grand and beautiful building. Can you guess what it might be? Answers on a postcard…

Managed to “chill out” in a restaurant for about 30mins. The plan had been to take it easy and stay there for a couple of hours however the service and food was fast and the bill was on the table as soon as we’d taken the last bite. We felt awkward trying to string out out the bottle of mineral water. Oh well back to Chennai Central and 3hrs of reading and people watching.

Karim & Annie had warned us of bedbugs on the overnight trains between Kerala and Chennai but we didn’t expect cockroaches. I hardly slept at all. One was hanging off Matt’s bag strap above his head at one point. Grim.
