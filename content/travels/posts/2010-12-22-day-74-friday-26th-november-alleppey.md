12:00 We are still in Alleppey. The plan was to leave this morning and go 10km away to stay in the Green Palm Homes on the backwaters to experience life there for real. Unfortunately Matt is too unwell. He was fine last night after dinner but hardly slept and now has flu-like symptoms. So we are having a chill-out day in Alleppey and will decide what to do next when he is feeling a little better. 

We don’t have to be anywhere until 30th November so there’s no rush. It’s also raining again so he timed it well.

Later that day….

We have upgraded rooms so at least we have TV and a veranda where we can get fresh air and read. 

As Matt is ill I ventured out on my own to look for food which was a different experience. Had lots more people staring at me and talking to me asking where I was from. Decided not to go in any restaurants as they were filled with men and I get enough stares when I’m with Matt let alone when it’s just me. 

Found a spicy chicken sandwich, samosas and weird bean filled savoury/sweet (we couldn’t decide) parcels plus pastries, crisps and soft drinks. What a feast! That ended up being lunch & dinner as Matt still couldn’t go too far from the loo and I didn’t fancy another trip out on my own in the dark.

So a sad day in all doing not much at all but watching crap on TV and reading and trying to burn photos onto DVDS so we can free up some darn space for more photos but it’s all gone pear-shaped and they won’t work! And breathe….
