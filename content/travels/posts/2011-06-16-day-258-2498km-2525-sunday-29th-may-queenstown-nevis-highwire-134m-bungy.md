OH MY GOD! Matt & I did a 134m bungy jump today. It was incredible!

Stupidly booked it for the afternoon so we both spent the morning sweating about it when all we wanted to do was get it over and done with. 

It was also a 45min drive out of town so our 2 o’clock appt was just for the bus ride. 

You get your full-body harness on and go on a open cable car across the canyon to the bungy car hanging over a massive canyon. That was pretty scary in itself.

There were 8 of us and we had to go in order of weight, heaviest first. So there was Matt & I waiting whilst the other 6 went first. I wasn’t sure that was a good idea. You could see the scared faces of one or two, hear the screams as they fell and through the perspex strips in the floor you could see each one bouncing up and down in the canyon looking like they were about to hit anything and everything rocky. However neither of us felt nervous.

As I watched the guy strap Matt into the safety gear and attach him to the bungy rope I started to worry. What are we doing? But when Matt jumped off the side into the abyss and come back up in one piece smiling and hyper I thought OK I’m fine I can do this. I’m not a heights person but I can do it.

Stood on the side of the platform looking across the valley my instincts took over. My heartrate quickened and my whole body was pulling me back from the edge telling me don’t do it. It took me a full minute to step off that edge and wow what a feeling. What a headrush. It was over so quickly but afterwards I felt different. Sounds really stupid but both of us felt like we were fearless.

As a reward for jumping 134m off a platform suspended on wires between two cliffs we headed to the Pub on the Wharf (thanks Evs for the recommendation) to relax with pie & beer/risotto & wine. Any excuse.
