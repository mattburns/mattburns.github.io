It’s sunny again. Hooray! So back to Renwick we trot, jump on a tandem bike (a first for both of us) and off round the vineyards we toddle.

1st stop: Forrest wines. We have a voucher for a free tasting tray from our kind bike hire guy at Old Mill B&B. Unfortunately just moments before arriving my trouser leg becomes trapped in the bike chain and rips half the hem off. I look a right hobo. 

Still the lady at Forrest wines doesn’t seem to mind and we try 3 whites, 2 reds and a bubbly.

The classic grape of Marlborough County is Sauvignon Blanc and this happened to be our favourite here. We’re surprised as it’s the cheapest bottle and we almost always prefer the expensive stuff and also because it’s less alcoholic than normal. A “healthy” wine at only 9.5%.

We buy our first bottle of the day and head onwards through the vines and stop to take a silly photo on self timer.

2nd stop: Wairau River winery for tasters of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Gris and Reserve Pinot Noir and a gourmet lunch. We plump for a glass of Pinot each – mine the Gris to go with blue cheese soufflé with pear & walnut salad and Matt’s Noir to complement his beef, spinach & blue cheese pizza. We had died and gone to heaven. I know I talk about food a lot but it is compulsory that I describe exactly what we ate and drank because it was exquisite on the taste buds. My mouth is watering as I type this.

Stop 3: No. 1 Family winery. We arrived to find three very Welsh guys chatting up the girl there. She couldn’t understand a word they were saying most of the time. Not sure it was their accents or just because they’d already been in 6 wineries beforehand. Tasted 3 bubbly wines so was a bit fuzzy-headed getting back on the tandem.

Stop 4: Georges Michel for Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier, Pinot Noir and Syrah tastings. We love the Pinot Noir so much we go for two bottles.

Stop 5: Fromm winery. They specialise in Pinot Noir so we leave with another couple of tastings in our bellies and another bottle of red in the panniers.

Stop 6 and final stop: Gibson Bridge where we bump into the Welsh guys again. They’d gone through free tastings at 9 wineries and were hoping to fit in one more before 5 o’clock closing time. The couple here were lovely. They set up the place themselves on 6 acres of land 3 years ago. They do everything just the two of them and they’d already won many awards. We went through 6 tastings I believe and Matt & I couldn’t agree on which wine we liked the most so we bought a bottle each. Both Pinot Gris but different years.

Our wine purchases:![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_5418.jpg)

Topped off the day as all classy wine tours should end with a pint of ale and a basket of chips at the Cork & Keg then settled down in our campervan for the night in the pub car park. 

Lush.
