Learned to surf today! You’d think by now we’d know how to use the internet (dad joke).

Anyhoo the sea was really rough with huge waves and we were both battered and bruised to within an inch of our lives but thoroughly enjoyed it. We even managed to stand on the board a few times. Credit to the surf teacher dude.

We enjoyed it so much we’re going to make sure we can surf again before we leave Oz.

Afternoon plan was to go for a walk through Noosa National Park. We were feeling far too lazy after all that energy burned on the waves so that will have to wait until tomorrow.
