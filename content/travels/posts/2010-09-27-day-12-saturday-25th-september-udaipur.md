We arrived in Udaipur late on 23rd and its not a bad substitute for Pushkar. 

So far in Udaipur:-
  
cows blocking Daiji bridge- squealing chinese tourist!
  
bathing ghats and old naked washing women
  
rooftop sunsets
  
beautiful lake and palaces
  
good aubergine and tomato curry plus garlic cheese naan @ Jasmine restaurant by the bridge
  
Quirky Vintage & Classic Car collection with veg thali – personal viewings of the cars including black Rolls Royce rfom Octopussy. Loopy waiter getting very close to my face and getting me to learn indian words. Then shoving a cone made of green leaf and mouth freshner bits into my mouth at the end!

Trivia – why was the RR on Rolls Royce badge red before 1931, then one red and one black in 1932, 1933, then both black since 1934? answers on a postcard….

Today was the City Palace and Boat ride around Lake Pichola past Jagniwas Island with Lake Palace Hotel completely covering it (69,000 rupees per night) and to jagmindir island covered by another palace surrounded by marble elephants. Very colonial.
