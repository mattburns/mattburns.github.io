Woke up this morning planning to do a Heli-hike. 10 min helicopter ride followed by 2hr glacier hike and 10min helicopter ride back. It was bland weather. Grey, overcast and chilly. And when we thought about it $400 each was a bit steep. So perhaps we just walk today and then see what the weather’s like in Fox Glacier tomorrow?

Well by the time we’d faffed about waking up and all that jazz and then watched huge trout jump around in the shallow river trying to get up stream, the sun was itching to come out. Hmm should we or shouldn’t we?

So we came to a compromise. We’d seen an advert for a $95 helicopter ride and thought if we can find a cheap ride without the hike we would do it. 

Well we met in the middle and at 11:00 somehow managed to get a 30-min $285 flight for $215 due to take off at 12:00. And get the front seats in the helicopter for a full 180 degree view. 

Unbelievable. This is another one of those experiences I can’t do justice to in describing it. It was my favourite moment of the entire trip so far. I know I’ve said that about other moments. And seeing Everest from Sandakphu and ziplining 400m across waterfalls in Laos are definitely up there but this was something else. Exhilarating. Unreal. 

20 mins of swooping around Franz Josef and Fox glacier, up the side of a waterfall, over the ice-capped mountains. Trying to land on one part of the ice teetering on a ledge only to realise it wasn’t as solid as it should be so zooming back up into the sky to find a safer stop.

We had 7 mins out on the glacier. Above the clouds, sun illuminating the white snow. Enough time for photos and snowballs and Matt even made a mini-snowman.

It was enough time up there to enjoy it and get a buzz that has lasted 12 hours and I hope will last for years.

We landed just as the clouds drew in and blocked the sun from view. We have been extra jammy today with kiwi & lime.

This afternoon we saw Franz Josef glacier from a different angle, from the bottom. You can drive to a carpark relatively near the glacier and then walk 30 mins across the old glacial bed to the 100m from the bottom of the ice.

This was beautiful too with luscious green hills either side <font color="#000000">peppered with waterfalls</font> and a river of clear blue glacier water running out from a tunnel at its base. Another world.
