Woke early to the sun shining through the perspex windows and birds chirping & chuckling.&nbsp; 

There is a wildlife sanctuary in the grounds of our accommodation which offer the opportunity to cuddle a koala. Matt wanted to get a photo of me doing this (and I wasn’t adverse to holding a koala either) so we joined in the tour. We both expected it to be cheesy and for kids. It was both but also now another favourite thing we’ve done on our trip. You get a real hands-on experience of Australian animals and it was interesting listening to the Steve Irwin character passionately talking about endangered crocodiles. We fed a large bird a pumpkin seed from our mouths which it peeled with its beak before eating, saw an echidna (small porcupine animal) eat dinner with a lizard, held lizards, a crocodile, a snake & a koala. And saw a joey on its mother’s back. It was the best $21 we’d spent in Oz. Fraser Island eat your heart out.

Cute koala videos:

You have to turn your head on its side for this one (sorry my inept camera work strikes again):

Even after the tour, we continued spotting wildlife. 

A number of these chaps were chilling out under some bushes near the kitchen.

And we saw a pair of porcupine thingymajigs out in the wild on an afternoon walk.

Ah yes our afternoon walk. It was meant to be an afternoon of snorkelling. We borrowed the gear, walked for 30mins to Arthur’s Bay, put all the gear on, stepped into the water to knee high and turned around and came back out. The water was cold and gravelly and the waves were strong. Neither of us are strong swimmers and after the incident in Sihanoukville where Matt almost drowned we thought better of it. A nice stroll around the bays made more sense. 

We had no map (I had a vague recollection of the route being 6km), no phone, flip flops on our feet and snorkel, mask & huge fins to carry with us. The sun was dropping behind the hills. Of course it made sense. 

To start with it was a normal tarmac road. A little sloping perhaps but no problem. We made a brief stop at Florence Bay, completely deserted and prettier than Arthur’s Bay. Skipped down to Radical Bay and back then followed the route along a narrow pathway with long grass either side which turned into a track through woodland and then a hilly rocky climb up and down the other side to Horseshoe Bay. The rocks were where we saw the echidnas. Well almost as the tide had come in so we had to clamber around the back of the mangroves following the water pipes into the bush to come out in a random side road which then went to Horseshoe Bay. Phew we made it. And the sun was just disappearing over the horizon.

It took a while, and no, flip-flops aren’t the best hiking gear but it was a beautiful walk, despite the rocky terrain. 

The rocky landscape of rounded boulders reminded us of Hampi and the Flintstones.

We treated ourselves to Billabongs. I have to mention this because we are addicted to these simple chocolate ice-cream lollies. They are delicious at any time of the day. Even twice a day. 

Back at Bungalow Bay we had to side-step a couple of possums on the way to the kitchen.

I think our Australian wildlife spotting is complete.
