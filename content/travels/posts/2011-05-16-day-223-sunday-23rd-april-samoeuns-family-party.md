Sunday was party day at Samoeun’s house. He works at Palm Garden Lodge and had invited us a few days ago. He was providing the food and we’d provide the beer.

At 3:30 when Samoeun finished work he took us off in his friend’s tuk-tuk to his home in another village on the outskirts of Siem Reap near West Baray. Stopped off on the way for a couple of crates of beer and a block of ice in a carrier bag.

We met his father who was an amputee and his step-mother. Also his two sisters that we’d not realised also worked at Palm Garden Lodge and made our breakfast every day.

We took American cookies as a present. Neither of knew for sure if that was apt but we were new to this.

Matt & I were given fresh coconuts to drink straightaway. I don’t know who but someone climbed up a tree and chopped them down especially for us. They put their electric fan on to cool us down and his dad instantly electrocuted himself with the dodgy wiring.

The beer and ice went into a big cool box and the food arrived by moped. Chicken pieces with spicy sauce, lemongrass & garlic chicken, salad and Khmer soup. The soup of coconut milk & noodles they’d only ordered specifically for Matt & I because we’d not tried it before. 

We all sat there on a bamboo mat in front of their house eating & drinking Angkor with ice. Every sip “Chul moy, chul moy” (cheers). Watching the chickens & their chicks run across our dishes of food as the dogs chased them and the chickens retaliated and ran at the dogs. The cats lay around contented whilst the dogs either ignored them or licked them.

Then the dancing started. Samoeun’s brother had brought over Khmer & Thai karaoke DVDs and Samoeun, obviously a keen dancer, grabbed Matt and up they were jigging about. Then it was my turn.

More and more neighbours appeared and it really was a party. We had to get another crate of beer of course. 

Had to leave at 8pm with our slightly tipsy tuk-tuk driver as I had to get up to teach the next morning but we wish we could have stayed longer. By that that time the whole neighbourhood seemed to have appeared. Although I felt outnumbered as they were all men.

It was good to meet Samoeun’s family and see where he lived. It’s an eye-opener to be in such a gorgeous setting – next to paddie fields, surrounded by palm trees – and see a tiny wooden home on stilts for 5 adults. No toilet. Just a piece of material to hide your modesty in the banana trees next to the chicken coop & pigsty. And a good community where everyone knows each other and helps each other out.
