Another nice early start and we were at Cairns domestic airport at 5:30 queuing Easyjet-stylie at the Virgin Blue check-in desks. We had checked in online to “save time”. We stood in the “Bag Drop Off” line for 25mins whilst people arriving late for the Brisbane flight were called forward followed by whoever felt like it from any of the lines. I wasn’t the only one mumbling under my breath I can tell you.

I guess it meant no faffing about with time to waste until boarding as we were straight on the plane and off to Sydney.

Unfortunately the weather was still pretty annoying this morning so we saw none of the Great Barrier Reef from the air.

We’d bought a “Flexi-fare”, not out of choice, but out of necessity due to us leaving it until the last minute to book it. This meant we had a complimentary breakfast. For the price of the ticket for a 2hour domestic flight we were expecting a gourmet feast. Imagine our faces when we were presented with a flimsy plastic tray holding a bottle of OJ and a granola bar. Then passed a muffin & a bag of apple slices by the stewardess. What a feast! Still it filled a gap. And I suppose we are in health-conscious Oz rather than fry-up guzzling UK.

Arrived in Sydney and had to get to Coogee (soft “g”) by bus.&nbsp; This meant 2 different buses. The first the no. 400 which we had to get off at Randwick junction. We were like lemmings. Constantly bobbing our heads up and down looking for the right stop. The bus driver chucked us off in Randwick at what definitely didn’t have a “junction” feel but more like a Bedmo High Street. Still it had a Subway and we were famished. It gave us time to work out where we needed to go first.

In fact it was pretty simple. There were buses to Coogee going past every 5 mins. Shame we managed to get one going in a slightly different direction. It dropped us off at the street we wanted but according to the nice helpful British girls we met in the bus stop and the Aussie lady next to them who knew better we had a nice steep hill to climb. Of course we did.

Anyway to cut a very long dull pointless story not very short we found Carrie’s flat at last!

To get over the jetlag we walked the 6km coastline from Coogee Beach to Bondi Beach. Immediately we could see why so many Brits come here and stay here. It’s like the English coast but with better amenities and consistently sunnier.

Even on a winter’s day.

Cemetery on the cliff.

Beautiful, poignant sculpture, a memorial for those who died in the Bali bombings in October 2002.

And they have loads of kooky old-fashioned swimming pools next to the sea where sometimes the waves come crashing over the walls smothering the swimmers. It was like travelling back in time watching the skull-capped swimmers moving up & down up & down.

And little coves where men dive into the freezing waters to get some exercise. Or try some diving.

After dilly-dallying along the way looking at interesting views, we finally reached the infamous Bondi Beach to find an upmarket version of Weston-super-mare with nothing less than an ice-rink on the darn beach. We’ve seen some surreal things throughout this trip and when we think we can’t possibly see anything weirder something crops up to surprise us again.

It was Bondi Beach’s Winter Wonderland. Ice-skating, sheds selling bratwursts and dutch pancakes and a beer tent with gas lamps serving German beer, gluhwein & pretzels with a guy playing the squeezebox singing Oktoberfest songs with a slight look on madness in his eyes. Not to mention the free Chai Latte tent with fake roaring fires and fake Christmas trees. All whilst surfers caught the waves that crashed on the beach behind.

Loved it.

We followed this excitement with a warming pint in the seafront Bavarian Bier bar and then had to work out how to get back to Coogee without having to traipse 6km back. It was a challenge as for some reason there are no buses between the beaches. Instead we got one bus to Bondi Junction then another to Coogee. We just about had the brain capacity left to deal with this.

Carrie took us out for a delicious Thai meal in Coogee that evening. It was our first proper meal out in a while as we’ve mostly been cooking in hostels in Australia. We also experienced our first liquor store walk-in freezer. Small things eh?

It’s nice to be staying in a proper home with a proper bed again and less than 20 people to share the bathroom with. Plus it’s good to see Sydney from the point of view of someone living here rather than just as a tourist. We’re getting to see things we wouldn’t have seen if we’d stayed in Kings Cross.
