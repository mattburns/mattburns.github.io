Unsure what to make of today. 

We were off the magical place of Fraser Island. A top destination for anyone visiting the East Coast of Australia, apparently.

We‚Äôd been ‚Äúsold‚Äù the bus trip by the guy at our hostel. We were going to do the 2-day 1-night camping but that was sold out so we were going to do the 1-day jeep but somehow he managed to persuade us the bus would be better. I think this is proof that we are out of our minds. How many times in NZ did we see hoards of people on bus trips being moved from place to place on a strict schedule and think or say how awful it looked and how we‚Äôd hate that kind of thing? Well we were right.

OK the weather didn‚Äôt help. Once again the sunny period that was promised for at least the next 3 days didn‚Äôt materialise. The blue skies of yesterday had been replaced by thick grey clouds. And at 7:15am it was bloomin freezing waiting to be picked up.

At 7:25 along comes our bus. It appears to be the same as the one in the photo so all is good. Big low windows, not too many seats. 40mins later after an exciting tour of the suburbs of Hervey Bay picking up from what seemed like every hotel & campsite we arrive at the ferry port.

Off we trot to get our tickets and then onto the ferry. It was quite a pleasant trip even though we were freezing our backsides off. Can I just point out that normally I‚Äôm pretty cautious about wearing layers just in case but we were expecting 100% sunshine so shorts & t-shirts & flip-flops didn‚Äôt really cut it on this open-air ferry.

Arriving at Fraser Island we were manoeuvred into the One Day Fraser Island Tour queue. Suddenly we were standing with what seemed like 100 other people all waiting to get on a very normal coach looking vehicle. It was a game of sardines. The windows were higher so you could barely see the ground and there was barely knee-space for me let alone anyone taller. I was livid. Matt was his usual optimistic self and said it will be fine.

OK so it wasn‚Äôt just a normal coach as it was 4WD and the roads across the island are all sand so you get a feeling of being on a rollercoaster. But it was still a busload of people to get from one place to the next.

And first stop was Central Station. A walk along a boardwalk through the rainforest to hear about the trees & creek for 30 mins with 50 other people. Sound like fun? I spent most of the time trying to take a photo of this kookaburra. It was the first one we‚Äôd seen and wildlife interests me more than trees.

Everything in the rainforest is gigantic ‚Äì a plant from the orchid family clinging onto a tree. It doesn‚Äôt feed off the tree.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P1070684.jpg)

We all piled back in the coach. Not a mean feat with so many to organise.

Next stop was Eurong Bay for 5 mins. And then we were on our way. The highlight ‚Äì driving along 75-mile beach. Well it was pretty cool for about 10 mins. Seeing the bush on one side and the waves on the other. It‚Äôs a shame we couldn‚Äôt see more of the sand but the windows were too high.

Speed limits on the beach.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P1070685.jpg)

And after 30mins it was a tad samey. Good job we encountered the shipwreck. That was actually a highlight of ours, be it we could only stop for 5 mins.

Next were the Coloured Sands & The Pinnacles. Probably another 20min drive. Here‚Äôs a photo.

That was worth the extra drive, eh?

We would go no further but backtrack to Eli Creek. A most fascinating place. A freshwater creek running into the sea. Well I‚Äôd never seen one of those before. Matt & I made ourselves have a paddle for the sheer hell of it and have to say it was pleasantly warm. Can see if the weather is right you could swim in it. But in the middle of winter that‚Äôs not going to happen.

Matt‚Äôs optimism had faded by now. He wandered off to have a look at the sea and a stick.

You could pay $70 for a 10-min trip in a plane to the next place. We didn‚Äôt but it was cool seeing them take off along the sand. ![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P1070714.jpg)

After all that excitement it was back to Eurong Bay for our buffet lunch. We stuffed our faces and made some takeaway ham & cheese rolls for the afternoon journey. Just to get our money‚Äôs worth üòÄ

Somehow the guide managed to get everyone on the bus promptly and we headed to Lake Mackenzie where we had 1hour 20mins to spend sunbathing and swimming in the lake. Not to miss an opportunity, even though it was still grey and had been raining whilst on the bus, we both braved the icy lake which was the clearest water we‚Äôd ever seen. It was a beautiful place and if it had been a boiling hot summer‚Äôs day you can see the attraction.

Spotted some more wildlife above the toilets whilst changing. The place was surrounded. Don‚Äôt they say that most spiders in Australia are poisonous?

That was the end of the trip. We arrived at the port to see the tide was lower than normal and wondered how the ferry would ever get to shore. We would be stranded with the spiders and the bus load of tourists. Arghh!

Luckily the captain of the ferry was extremely talented and did some magnificent 3-point turning to get the ferry along the narrow creek and into position. We all piled on and waited with baited breath to see if we could move or be mud-bound.

With the help of the vehicles on board which were moved to the end of the ferry we were able to edge along the creek and out into the ocean. We were free!

And there ends one of the most expensive days this entire trip. And one of the most disappointing. There were some good bits don‚Äôt get me wrong. The shipwreck was cool and the lake was pretty. But the highlight was the return ferry journey. We even saw a couple of dolphins disappear into the shadows as the sun set.

We know now that we should have stuck to our guns and did the jeep trip. We just don‚Äôt do buses!
