Happy 30th Birthday Lisa & Happy Birthday Leah!

**Tuesday**

Back to teaching yesterday and today was jam-packed. Had the same class at the primary school again. This time Mikael another volunteer came and helped me.

Tuesday evening I taught Level 1-1 again on my own this time. Which was fine for a while but soon became rowdy. I played a running game with them where they had to draw pictures on the board and write the word I was saying like Cat, Hat, Fan, etc. Davone came to help out with calming them down in Lao and taught the word for quiet – Miet!. It was very entertaining watching them draw with their classmates in their team shouting at them. Absolute carnage but good fun.

From 6 til 7 was Level 2-2 (14-16 plus 1 10-year old) and I was completely unprepared for it. Only 6 students and had 2 guys taking the piss the whole time. It was hard to make “that is a chair, those are chairs, those are four chairs” an interesting lesson.

As the power was off all over Vang Vieng again including the farm, Matt couldn’t spend all day on stolencamerafinder again so he went for his first run in 5 months. He was half-dead when I got back! Really must do more.

**Wednesday** 

Same kids again in the morning where we learned the letter M. Much easier than L. I got my camera out 5 mins before the end and they went loopy. They wouldn’t stay still so as well as taking a few pics I had to do a small video to be able to see them properly. It’s the cutest thing as they’re waving and saying Sabaidee but can’t put it on this blog at the moment.

Evening time I taught Level 1-2 this time and then Level 2.  A hot air balloon almost came down across the road during the Level 1 class so they were more interested in that. Level 2 I was better prepared and there more students (10) who weren’t being smart arses.

Whilst I was at school Matt went out taking photos of Vang Vieng and captured a pic of the same hot air balloon which we’d seen in class.

**Thursday**

Had the best Level 2 class yet. I’d made up a wordsearch which seemed to entertain them and another temp volunteer, Gijs helped. He also took some pics of me teaching. And when I said it was my last day one of the girls came up to me and said I was a very good teacher. Ahhhh.

**Friday**

No teaching later so no prep needed. We used the moped to go to Blue Lagoon. 7km away from Vang Vieng through stunning scenery again and the blue lagoon was idyllic. Although I managed to get a “Thailand tattoo” as I burned a mark on my leg from the exhaust pipe. Luckily we were at the lagoon so I could go and jump straight in to cool it down.

Stopped at the local community project on the way back to ask about the weaving. Really enthusiastic guy who turned out to be at the school meeting that evening and is linked to the EEFA. He’s trying to set up teaching in Nathong village, help locals start up weaving by paying for looms, create bio-gas from manure to fuel homes rather than them using wood and initiate trekking into the hills and overnight camping to help fund this. Currently building a community centre.

[ Update 03/10/2011: Sengkeo (Bob) has kindly sent the correct website for this inspirational project: [http://www.saelaoproject.com](http://www.saelaoproject.com/) ]

To get to the lagoon you either have to pay to go over the toll bridge or you can go over the footbridge for free. Here’s Matt skilfully not crashing the moped into the river:![P1040811](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/02/P1040811.jpg)

The school meeting was very official. All the members of the executive board and the teachers were there. Plus all the kids to pick up their books. At the end I was saying goodbye and I saw Khamkeo one of the level 3 students and told him I was leaving so he gave me a friendship bracelet he’d made for good luck and fortune. How sweet!
