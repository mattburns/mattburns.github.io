6am outside Tourists Rest House, no sign of our lift. Not surprised as we weren’t interested in his all day tour of Agra for 600 rupees. We just wanted a lift to the Taj Mahal and play it by ear.
  
Found another keen soul who nicely ripped us off as he didn’t have any change. Then found out that he’d dropped us off at East Gate and the booking office was 1km away.
  
Refusing to be conned by more tuk tuk drivers we stubbornly walked all the way there whilst an even keener guy followed us all the way to the booking office on his bicycle tuk tuk.
  
For some reason it didn’t matter how far we walked the price was still the same! We gave in again on the way out and had a nice lift back down to the gate.

With the sun already being up as it was 6.45 by then we’d missed the sunrise over the Taj but that didn’t stop us being amazed by the fantastic beauty of the building. It was surreal. Like a painting superimposed on the landscape.
  
We both wondered how something so beautiful and perfect could be surrounded by such poverty.

the early shift paid off as there wasn’t the crowds at that time as we saw later that day.

we treated ourselves to a rooftop breakfast at Gulshan Restaurant, another LP recommendation just near South Gate where we could see the top of the Taj not too far beyond the crumbling rooftops of the restaurants and shops and the monkeys and the pigeons.
  
(we had just seen one monkey shoot across the road after being caught stealing from a shop – those guys can move fast!)
  
15 rupees for a large shot of yummy sweet milky coffee, toast and banana. Served by a boy no older than five who would change in an instant. One minute looking so so sad and the next his eyes glistening with a smile.
  
He was fascinated with the pictures in our LP guide and named all of the foods he could see in english. I tried to explain that the cafe was in the book and after trying to pronounce “gulshan” unsuccessfully 4 times to him as he looked confused at me and said “uh??”, matt got it right first time.
  
on clearing away our plates he tried to get matt to drink the last of his coffee. after the 3rd failed attempt he picked up the glass, went to the side of the terrace and poured it over the side together with the banana skins.
  
we paid his brother and sister who were no more than 8 years old themselves and their father (presumably) was sat chatting on the front terrace leaving them to it.
  
I could have easily scooped up the 3 of them there and then to take them away from it all.

we decided to walk to the Red Fort, 2km away through the park and past a ghat with colourful Hindi statues and burning wood. Many men were there and no women so we left quickly.
  
we had to stop again as a procession of men, maybe 100 or more, walked past, some carrying a wooden stretcher with a colourfully wrapped body going to the ghat for the funeral,
  
i definitely felt like i shouldn’t be there but it was a privilege to see.
  
the Red Fort was fantastic too (apart from almost being bribed by the guard to take our laptop in) we spent hours people and monkey watching

a sunset trip to the Mehtab Bagh park to see the Taj Mahal from the north side of the river
  
our tuk-tuk was stopped by guards at a bridge on the way and our driver said something about $10 but he managed to blag it so we could cross without paying (apparently that happens a lot to tourists and matt’s white legs may have been our giveaway :) )
  
through a poor area of Agra to the edge of the river, again more guards sat to our side made it an uneasy mood. but the view was again amazing and as it rained a little a rainbow to the left of the Taj really topped it off.
  
our driver prompted us to leave before complete sunset. i think he was worried aboutthe tax on the way back. so i covered my arms and we sat back in the tuk tuk to make us less conspicuous which seemed to work.

back at TRH we bumped into James from Nirvana Hostel and shared some veg curry whilst chatting about our next plans and getting the giggles when the guy came to take our room numbers. it all got a bit confusing when we said we were in 123 and james was in 132. the guy couldn’t deal with that.
