Not sure why exactly but we stayed in Bangkok until Wendy came back.

We had wanted to go to the coast but with the weather being so terrible we didn’t want to risk it. And with Matt keen to get on with [www.stolencamerafinder.com][1] we pottered about doing not much at all except that.

Wednesday night we tried a kooky restaurant called Cabbages & Condoms in Sukhumvit. It’s a restaurant that gives some of its profits to HIV/AIDS charities. You eat in a lovely garden setting surrounded by trees filled with lanterns. The quirky thing is that the lampshades are made from condoms. And they have mannequins stood everywhere with different outfits on, all made from condoms. Very creative.

The final touch, instead of an after-dinner mint, you get to take home a free condom. Ingenious.

Whilst looking for a birthday card for Matt’s niece Lily Scarlett we found an arcade with that basketball game where you have to score as many baskets as possible in 2 mins. Haven’t played that in years. Needless to say both of us were abysmal in comparison to the guys next to us. 79 to 250-something.

After 5 nights in Sunflower Place and because we are staying Bangkok we decide to find something cheaper. Amazingly we find Unico Express in Sukhumvit for 540THB per night and book for 3 nights. It has a flat-screen TV, a mini-bar and an outdoor swimming pool. Plus with 12% off via hotels.com via [quidco.com][4] we’re laughing. They must have got their prices wrong. 

OK it’s not in the best of locations. 15 mins walk from Sukhumvit Road which turns out to be chocca-block with girlie bars. Hmmm not great. But we manage to find Cheap Charlie’s bar a bit further away, another quirky place built on a street corner selling cheap Chang. 

We have been in Bangkok over a week now and I start to get cabin fever and kind of wish I’d headed down south with W & S. But then again I think how often do they get a holiday just the two of them. So it’s a good thing really. But I don’t have much to occupy myself whilst Matt is trying to make our millions. Then I have a brainwave. If I have my own laptop I can help him more easily with [SCF][5].

So after taking at least 2 seconds to convince Matt it’s a good investment whilst we’re travelling on a budget we head to Fortune mall, a computer geek’s paradise. Honestly if I hadn’t have been there Matt would have spent a small fortune.

We’d left our shopping expedition a little late so everything was closing. But we found an ideal netbook and went back to investigate online. (yawn)

It seemed a good deal so the next day we were back at Fortune mall buying our little bargain of an Acer netbook from Tesco Lotus (yes Tescos can you believe it they are officially taking over the world). 

Anyway that shut me up for a little while and Matt got back to [SCF][5] coding whilst we waited for Wend & Steve to return.

And on Thursday we return to Sunflower Place for 3 reasons. 1. because Unico had twigged and doubled their prices. 2. because it was back to where we thought W & S would be staying. 3. because we know the area and we like the Japanese ramen noodle place on Silom Road. They do delicious slow-cooked beef & pork ribs plus Chrysanthemum tea. And around the corner at Sala Daeng station there is the juice bar with Guava juice and Passionfruit & beetroot juice.&nbsp; Mmmmm.

By the way the weather has started to improve at last. Sun has been out and it’s pretty darn humid here. Hope W & S got some sun.
