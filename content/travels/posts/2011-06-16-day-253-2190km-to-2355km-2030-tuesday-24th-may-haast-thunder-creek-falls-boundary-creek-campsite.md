Non-eventful day.

Woke up, it was raining. Run was pointless. Nowhere to run to except around the carpark 4 times getting wet.

Stayed in all morning blogging & working on [SCF](https://www.stolencamerafinder.com/). It rained some more.

Drove to Haast. Grey, depressing place in winter. The cheapest tin of baked beans in their only shop was $2. Wanted fish & chips but couldn’t bring ourselves to try the bleak cafe. Stubbornly ate pasta-in-sauce on the side of the road whilst it drizzled and continued on our way. We’ll get our perfect Fish & Chips by the beach. One day.

Paused for 10 mins to see Thunder Creek Falls. Highlight of the day.

Now parked up at Boundary Creek DOC campsite about 40km north of Wanaka and the skies are still showering the van. The wind has joined in too in rocking us side to side. Maybe the back windows will end up cleaning themselves so we don’t have to.

Fingers-crossed it clears up for the morning as we would have a lovely view across the swathe of Lake Wanaka to the hills and snow-capped mountains behind.

Dusk view

Funny how I still manage to write reams of text after that initial sentence but there we are.
