What do you do when you’re at the seaside? Go lie on the beach all day of course.

We hadn’t seen the sea since New Year in Thailand and it sounds sad but it was really exciting. Being by the Mekong is lovely but you just can’t beat seeing the sea stretch out to the horizon merging with the blue sky and the sound of waves on the sand. Lush.

It was too hot to be in the sun all day so we snoozed on loungers with a sun umbrella protecting us. Or so we thought. Red bits and tan lines ahoy.

The beach is lovely but you can’t relax for very long. We were shocked at how many people including kids spend their days walking up and down touting for business. Massage mister, manicure / pedicure lady, women offering to thread my armpits. Um no thanks. I’m lying on a beach in public and its boiling hot. Why would you want to go near my armpits? 

They sold fruit, mini lobsters (delicious by the way) and barbequed squid on sticks. One woman had a mobile bar-b-q. She had a wooden pole across her shoulder. One end carried the ice-box and utensils. Hanging from the other end was a bar-b-q bucket with hot coals, a grill and some squid sat there sizzling away. We could feel the heat from a couple of metres away she must have been cooking herself at the same time.

One girl was quite funny. She came and sat next to me, took one look at my grey hair and smiled. Then proceeded to start pulling them out one by one. After three I had to ask her to stop otherwise I think she would have continued until I was bald.

A guy also asked us our ages and again commented “young face, old hair”. I am definitely dying my hair at the next opportunity!

There are a lot of children trying to sell you bracelets during the day and fireworks at night. I had one boy chatting to me who made me what he called a good-luck bracelet for free which I didn’t want. He got stroppy then because I was disrespecting his country. It is so sad that they have to do this. They say they go to school but you see them wandering around the beaches at all hours. 

And there are many disabled men begging on the beach at night. Many have been maimed by landmines. They don’t get welfare. 

The only real way to help is give money to the local charities so that you know its going to the right place. But we felt so bad. We as wealthy tourists sitting there relaxing on their beach spending money on food and drink while so many locals are struggling to survive.

On St Patricks Day we decided to try the 25c beer at Utopia. This is a place recommended in the LP and it seemed quite a normal bar when we went in there.

Once happy hour had ended we looked up from our half-pints to find the place had turned a little seedy. Everywhere you looked there were young girls in tiny dresses loitering around lardy western guys. And these guys were all ages. I suddenly felt out of place in my vest top and baggy trousers. Once again the western world is having a negative influence on other countries. 


Amazing Friday spent on a posh [boat tour][4]. Snorkelling in the morning, freshly cooked lunch on-board, tea-coloured river walk in the afternoon and lazing on the most gorgeous beach ever.

At the snorkelling point Matt joined a few other guys in daring to jump off the top of the boat into the sea. I was a wimp. Managed to climb over the barrier but couldn’t bring myself to jump. Silly as Wendy & I used to jump off the coves in Menorca when we were younger.

After lunch the boat anchored offshore of Koh Rong Samloem island and we could choose to swim or take the speedboat. I decided to swim. I’m not a strong swimmer and wasn’t sure if I could make it but sometimes you just have to go for it. And after not jumping off the boat I was out to prove something. The water was crystal clear and so warm. And luckily for me shallow after about 25metres of swimming.

They took us on a half hour walk through tea-coloured river up to our waists and sometimes deeper to learn about mangroves and other plants growing in this area. My flip-flop broke as soon as we entered the water so I was bare-foot. I hate not knowing what’s in the water I’m in so this was a pulse-raising experience for me. I’m sure something brushed past my leg a few times.

We skipped the rainforest walk and so glad we did. Instead spent half hour on the practically deserted beach and swimming in the sea. We never get to go in the water together really as we’re always worried about someone stealing our stuff. It was lush. 

As soon as they came back from their walk we had to swim back to the boat and the beach time had been our favourite part of the trip.

Our last day in Sihanoukville was a non-event. Had a sleeper bus booked for 8pm to Siem Reap so once we checked out we sat in the Cool Banana bar all day long using their wifi and watching their projector.

The sleeper bus was bizarre. Nothing like the one from Hampi to Goa in India. There were two levels of completely reclined seats. We were on the bottom level and couldn’t really sit up. The lights didn’t work either so you had no choice but to go to sleep if you had no torch. The on-board deluxe toilet was revolting. And the bus driver was a maniac. Sitting up whilst a coach is over-taking and swerving in the dead of night is definitely more palatable than lying down. Oh well another day another interesting experience and we’re still here to bore everyone with the tales.
