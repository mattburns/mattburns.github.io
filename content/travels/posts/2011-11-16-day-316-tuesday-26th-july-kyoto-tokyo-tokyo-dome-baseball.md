Back to Tokyo again today. Our final trip on the Shinkansen and I think we have got our money’s worth.

Based on Google maps we did a total of 1104 miles which is about ¥25 per mile (approx 20p). That’s cheaper than our old RX-8&nbsp; (when we were materialistic and had money to spend on silly cars).

In detail for anyone who likes this kind of stuff, like me, the distances were Tokyo –> Hiroshima (507 miles), Hiroshima –> Miyajima (16 miles), Miyajima –> Hiroshima (16 miles), Hiroshima –> Kyoto (224 miles), Kyoto –> Nara (26 miles), Nara –> Kyoto (26 miles), Kyoto –> Tokyo (289 miles).

Arriving back at K’s House Tokyo Oasis we dumped the bags and decided to head to the baseball. Neither of us know anything about baseball but it seems a popular sport over here so we thought why not?

Walking out of Korakuen tube station, a fairly central stop in Tokyo, you are met with a gigantic roller-coaster.

Then you spot the [Tokyo Dome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome) and that is a monster of a building. A 55,000 seater stadium specifically for baseball. Wow.

We had been correctly informed by K’s House that we could obtain tickets once we got there. There were a range of tickets and us being on a tight budget we opted for the cheapest – standing room only – the assumption being it would be like at a football match where you get a stepped terrace to loiter on.

That was an incorrect assumption. You know when you’re at a stadium and you can wander along at the top of the seated areas to buy food & drink, this is the standing area. You find a space along the edge and lean on the barriers.

It was fun though. We didn’t really mind as we didn’t have to move at all. They had plenty of beer girls running up and down the steps with the keenest eyesight. The moment you raised you hand an inch one would come skipping up between the seats and pour you a pint of Kirin or Asahi. ![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/10/P1080688.jpg)

Matt suddenly loved baseball.

Our view from our spot by the pillar.

Matt wished he’d invested in some quality binoculars when the mid-innings entertainment came out on the pitch.

It’s difficult to tell from this photo but the crowd were mental. And not just crazy pockets of people like at football who start off a song and then others join in, this was mass organisation of chanting. And as soon as play started again they would all stop in unison. In their white and orange jerseys.

We think the home side lost. It was difficult to tell seeing as a) everything was in Japanese and b)&nbsp; I don’t understand anything and Matt doesn’t understand enough about baseball to know exactly what was going on. I definitely know I learned that it’s a slower game than I realised. There is a lot of standing around and not as much running as I thought. But it was a fantastic atmosphere and it was good to experience a sport that is obviously loved in Japan. It must be to have that size of stadium in the middle of the capital city!

Hungry as ever we went on an epic tube journey trying to find somewhere to eat. First stop was Roppongi. We headed out of the tube station and found ourselves in a posh apartment/ office block next to a flyover. It didn’t look like the kind of place we would find some food that would suit the kind of people we were looking like in the same clothes we’d lived in for 10 months.

So we popped back on the tube and tried Shinjuku instead. This turned out to be a little seedy. Lots of post-work businessmen clogging up the restaurants with randomly dressed girls hanging around the streets. Plus flashing blue lights and sirens going off here there and everywhere.

I felt a little uncomfortable and grouchy as my rumbling stomach was getting the better of me. As we were about to give up and go back on the tube we spotted a busy fast food joint called Gindaco with guys stood at tables with beer and trays of interesting looking balls of something. It seemed more inviting than the other food places in this area.

Turns out they were octopus balls. Well balls made of octopus. Called [Takoyaki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takoyaki). Smothered in some sauce and cheese eaten with chopsticks.

They were delicious. And not just because we were starving by this point.

Made it back to K’s and found we’d missed the free drinks evening they do every Tuesday by about 4 hours. On the plus side they’d left some of the free booze on the table so we sat and drank dodgy red wine and sake out of juice cartons whilst making paper cranes.

This is Matt’s example of his origami skills. Mine was shameful.

Looking forward to a lie-in tomorrow as next on the agenda is Mount Fuji…
