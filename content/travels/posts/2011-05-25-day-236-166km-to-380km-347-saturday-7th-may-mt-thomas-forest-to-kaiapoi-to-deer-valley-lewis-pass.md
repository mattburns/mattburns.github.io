That muddy field we were in had increased in bogginess overnight and also half-filled with anorak-covered people putting up tents whilst we were eating brekkie which meant fun for us getting out. We discovered today that our campervan doesnâ€™t have great traction so we slid about all over the place trying to manoeuvre around tents, cars & vans to just about get out safely.

We also discovered that although we thought the grey water indicator wasnâ€™t working it in fact is. And a blocked shower and sink arenâ€™t good to have when off-roading. The sink aggressively threw washing up water all over the floor. 

Next mission â€“ try to find dumpstation in Rangiora. We knew Rangiora as weâ€™d passed through on the way to Grey Valley. But could we find it? Hell no. I used to be proud of my map-reading and navigational skills. They seem to have disintegrated in the past 8 months.

So we gave up and headed to Kaiapoi. It is 20km north of Christchurch and has also been affected by earthquake. Many shops were closed with cracks here and there.

It was still peeing it down but we finally found the dumpstation. This time it was Mattâ€™s turn to get soaked and he was emptying the grey water ðŸ˜‰

Having not used internet for a couple of days we were eager to check [SCF][2] stats and email and managed to spot a dodgy laundry/internet place. Seems itâ€™s more expensive here for internet than in Asia at $2 for half hour. 

And we finally got moving towards Hanmer Springs.

Deer Valley, the only free DOC campsite near Hanmer was in fact 70m away and was pretty much a layby next to a stream. It was worth the extra drive though for the amazing scenery â€“ very LOTR. So pretty with all the autumnal colours.&nbsp;

Itâ€™s pitch-black outside. when you switch off the lights in the van the only thing you can see is one tiny red led light for the fridge and all you can hear is the stream bubbling by. 

And right at this moment I am catching up on some blogging and Matt is working on [www.stolencamerafinder.com][4] sat in a campervan listening to an iPod through the stereo somewhere in the middle of New Zealand.
