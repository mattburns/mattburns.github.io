…I was wrong. In Thailand you expect to veer off the road into a tree at any time but at least the seats are suited to overnight travel. The Greyhound buses in Oz are the worst for sleeping on. Their seats are just a little too small to curl up on so you can never get comfy. The aircon was on so it was cold too. And to top it off the onboard loo wasn’t functioning. So 15 mins later we had to make an adhoc loo stop. 

After less than 5 and a half hours we were being manoeuvred off the bus into the Reef Terminal in Cairns. Which is basically a glorified set of bus stops. 

We had 90mins to kill before our pick-up. What to do? I spied a guy with a McDonalds coffee. That will do.

There we were at 7am eating bacon & egg McMuffins & drinking flat whites and lattes. Their coffee has definitely improved. Or were we just knackered?

Anyway after a nightmare journey the lovely Jenny from Dreamtime backpackers turns up and gives us a lift to the hostel. It really is only a 15min walk (maybe 20 with backpacks) but we’re glad of the ride and of the brekkie.

Too early for our room we end up sat in Cairns Central mall just across the road for a while, admiring the Wendy’s shake & dog deal.

Our attention is then drawn to the lagoon in town and we head there for some relaxation until the room is ready. What a gorgeous free facility. UK Government take note. We want open plan infinity pool lagoons in our towns. With free bar-b-qs. And showers. And fake beach.

Our room is ready and it’s the cutest little shed you’ve ever seen in the garden next to the swimming pool. I’m sure fairies built it.

The sun is glowing now so what do you do? Sunbathe by the lagoon, swim in the lagoon (for a few mins cos it is cold in there!), cook Aussie burgers on the free hot plate using the cheapest tongs we could purchase from Woolworths supermarket and just generally chill. 

Normally we prefer smaller towns but we actually quite like Cairns.
