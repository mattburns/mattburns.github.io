Is it really March already? Unbelievable. Where does the time go when you’re having fun travelling around Asia? 

Monday’s journey consisted of a 20min long boat from the bottom of the garden of Souchitra guest house (opposite our guest house) across the Mekong to Ban Muang, then a minivan for 90 mins down to Hat Xai Kun, followed by a 10min small longtail back across the Mekong to Muang Khong on Don Khong island.

The rest of the morning consisted of me panicking about not having any cash as we’d realised there were no ATMs in Champasak or Si Phan Don so after checking into a guest house which left us with the equivalent of £3.50 in our wallets we headed to the only bank in the area. No they didn’t take visa or mastercard but they did exchange good dollar notes. No old crumpled ones were allowed. Luckily we had a few that were good enough. Panic over we spent the remainder of Monday doing pretty much nothing at all. Except Matt did get another feature working on stolencamerafinder so he was grinning from ear to ear.

Another early start as we hired bikes to cycle across the island past nothing but buffalo and rice paddies, most were dried out as its the dry season but some had irrigation channels and were a luscious carpet of green. Not much to see on the other side apart from the hills of Cambodia so cycled around the bottom half of the island passing kids shouting sabaidee and holding their hands out for high 5s. 

Nothing to do but chill for the rest of the day (or work on stolencamerafinder :). Don Khong is that kind of place. You can’t help but relax there.![IMG_3085](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_3085.jpg)
