It is very very hot today. brought back memories of India & SE Asia, carrying our backpacks through searing sunshine.

After our 3rd visit in as many days to Bakery Roti around the corner from J Hoppers, our favourite supplier of random bakery items, we struggled onto a packed tram with all the shoppers. Stares were a plenty as we blocked the narrow alleyways with our ugly luggage. It was a relief to get onto the cool air-conditioned Shinkansen to Kyoto.

Kyoto feels different to Hiroshima. More old, understandably, and more new. The main train station is a monster. Huge glass building stuffed to the brim with platforms and eateries and escalators and shopping centres.

It took us a while to find our next abode and we were hot and sticky in just 15 mins of walking in the humidity.

Headed to Gion, the old quarter of Kyoto where there are a lot of temples. Somehow we managed to miss the opening times of most of them but came across the Yasaka-jinja Shrine where we could potter about.

I insisted we go to a traditional tea making ceremony and we tried [En][5] just around the corner from the temples. It is tucked into a tiny side street in Gion and you feel like Harry Potter walking through the wall onto platform 9¾ as the hustle & bustle of the busy modern streets disappear behind and you knock on the door of a small modest wooden building.

Once inside the traditional house you’re definitely another world away. We joined two other tourists kneeling on the tatami floor and watched a lady in traditional dress spend 35 minutes explaining the process in such a precise manner she seemed almost robotic. Every utensil and every movement has a meaning. Even the direction in which the tea bowl is held in the hand so that the pattern faces the recipient and then it is turned 3 times. The tea drinker should also hold the cup with the pattern facing outwards so that other people at the ceremony can admire and discuss the cup.&nbsp; We even got to make our own tea using powdered green tea and were given a neat turquoise jelly sweet to complement the tea. It was fascinating. Even Matt enjoyed it.

Leaving the place you felt like you had been dreaming and had just woken up coming back to reality.

We explored more of Gion looking for a tasty restaurant but couldn’t find one to suit our budget in the quirky lantern-lit streets.

Instead we headed to a more commercial area and the had-to-be-done conveyor belt sushi bar. With queues out the door we had time to be nosey at what the protocol was. Pretty much the usual. Take what you want. Pile up the plates. Get charged per plate. Easy. Plus drink as much green tea as you like and watch the chefs in the centre prepare plate after plate of unusual sushi, hoping your favourite would come around next.

These were our favourite – tuna and quail eggs I believe.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_9426.jpg)

The couple next to us were hungrier than we were. These plate piles are for 2 people. We only had one pile that high for both of us.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_9432.jpg)

After sushi, we went down a teeny staircase to a corridor of an underground bar and had a civilised Irish coffee served in teacups with sugar cubes and dainty silver teaspoons. Late night coffee seems to be a popular past-time in Japan. Would a late night coffee bar work in the UK without being full of lairy folk? Me thinks not.
