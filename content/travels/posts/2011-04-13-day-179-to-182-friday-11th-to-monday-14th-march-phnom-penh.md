I have been particularly slack on the blog writing front so am typing this a month after the event. Therefore it will be dry and sparse as my memory has faded and we have few photos.

From Sen Monorom we went to the capital Phnom Penh, on a normal bus, with one passenger per seat. It took 7 hours, less than we thought, and the journey went surprisingly fast.

By the time we’d settled into our hotel and ventured out it was dark so we couldn’t be bothered to explore too far for food. To Matt’s delight we found BB World. Nothing to do with Blackberry but Cambodia’s answer to McDonalds. Air-conditioned, free wifi, fake sugary mr whippy ice-cream. What more could you ask for when you’ve just landed in a big strange city after being out in the sticks?

Saturday morning in daylight we were more relaxed about Phnom Penh. Visited the Psar Toul Tom Pong, also known as the Russian market, a large covered market place selling anything you can think of. I bought a _genuine_ “Gap” vest top for $1.50 (many clothes factories are in Cambodia) and we purchased our first real souvenir – a teapot set. One of those cute little ones with a bamboo handle and six little cups the size of eggcups. We have no kitchen to put it in but I’m sure it’ll come in handy.

Continuing our fast food fetish we tried out KFC. Its hot over here OK! They gave us food on real china plates. How posh is that? Could you see that happening in the UK?

Next stop was the [Tuol Sleng genocide museum][1]. It was one of the most harrowing experiences. Before 1975 it was a school. From 1975 to 1979 it was a torture prison used by the Khmer Rouge. Photos were displayed of all who died there. And of some who worked there. Most were so young. It was shocking. Neither of us wanted to take any photos. Why would you? You go there to learn, to see for yourself what happened, to reflect. You’re not going to show your family photos of torture chambers, 2ft by 5ft prison cells and graves in a schoolyard. And its not something you yourself would want to look over again. But so many of the tourists there had their cameras out clicking away.

To change the subject and talk about food yet again Matt ordered frogs for dinner. They have tiny bones. Fiddlier than chicken wings. But tasty. Like chicken…

Sunday we took a wander to the Victory of Independence monument. Yet another huge archway in a capital city. Why did these become so trendy? It was built in 1958 and is meant to look similar to Angkor Wat architecture.

Matt joined the [Phnom Penh Hash House Harriers][3] for their weekly Sunday afternoon run. Off he went at 14:30 in the back of a pick-up truck to the edge of the city to run 10k along the edge of the Killing Fields.

> Hi, Matt here, thought I’d just start typing some blog in the middle of Karen’s blog… I just turned up to meet the running club in the midday heat for a run. They were an interesting bunch with t-shirts saying things like “Dodging landmines since 1992”. A little worrying when Cambodia has an estimated [10 million active landmines](http://www.unicef.org/sowc96pk/hidekill.htm) lying around. A [hash run](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_House_Harriers) is a strange orienteering style run where you have to run through fields and villages looking for little markers and trying not to get lost too much. The main purpose seems to be to run in the heat and get really thirsty so that you enjoy the beers more at the end. Excellent. Since I didn’t get seriously lost or blown up, I’ll hand it back to Karen…

Whilst Matt was out running and getting lost in the mine-fields I went for a bit of a wander round the shops. Central Market is an odd one. Its a retro domed building with four “legs” containing a mishmash of stalls selling the usual clothes, bags, souvenirs or fish, with alleyways of manicurists and pedicurists and in contrast the centre dome is like a large jewellery department in Debenhams. Glass cabinets of sunglasses, necklaces, watches and sparkling crystals fill the floor.

Somehow I didn’t buy a single thing. And Matt wasn’t even there to stop me from spending.
