Airlie Beach is the “jumping off point” (LP says this all the time and I hate it with a passion!) for Whitsunday sailings. 

We decided not to bother. They were really expensive and we want to go diving in the Great Barrier Reef from Cairns so we’ll only be staying here a day.

The thing is there isn’t much else here. Well there is. It has a street of restaurants and bars and backpackers and travel agents selling sailing trips and a man-made lagoon because you can’t go in the water because of the crocodiles. But it doesn’t have any character. And all anyone talks about is the Whitsunday sailing.

As we arrived at 7am we had walked around the town by 9:30 so we spent a lot of the day relaxing in the hammocks in the garden at our hostel.

At 5pm, however, we did something uniquely Aussie. We had a didgeridoo lesson. There were about 14 of us in a shop, didges on the counter, learning to play. Matt was a natural of course and even shocked the teacher with his circular breathing which normally takes a few days to learn. I didn’t have a bloody clue. Most of my playing sounded like farting. Matt’s sounded more tuneful and that caused a problem. We had to buy one now didn’t we.

Spent 90mins pondering and testing them out and pondering some more and thinking it’s too much money but we really like them and it would be cool to have it and learn to play but we just saved money on Whitsundays and now we’re blowing it on a piece of wood but it is a beautiful piece of wood and it would be lush to have one and we can get our own aboriginal symbols put on it etc, etc, etc.

So we have the above didgeridoo on order which will be winging its way to the UK in August. Better get practicing that circular breathing.
