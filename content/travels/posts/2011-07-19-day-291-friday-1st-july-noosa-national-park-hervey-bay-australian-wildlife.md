Noooo it can’t be 1st July already? That means only 4 weeks left. Better make the most of it then.

Up nice & early with the idea of going for a 3 hour walk through Noosa National Park to spot wild koalas and kookaburras before catching the lunchtime bus to Hervey Bay. 

On checking out the girl says “have you seen the koala at the end of the driveway”? And there he was sat calm as anything back to the world clinging onto the high branches on a eucalyptus tree next to the busy roundabout by our hostel.&nbsp; He occasionally turned his head very slowly around and looked down at the interested crowd beneath with click clicking cameras seeming nonplussed by all the attention he was getting.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

It appears that seeing one this close-up and in full-view is rare. We overheard a passerby say to her young daughter “look at that, normally we only get to see their bum, don’t we?”.

So our mission to see wild koalas had been fulfilled before even leaving for the national park.

Still we went on our wander around the park. We took the coastal path which passes a number of surfing coves.

Then headed inland up through the Tangled Forest on the lookout for more wildlife. Needless to say we didn’t spot a single koala bear. Not even a cheek. Nor any kookaburras although we may have heard one. Matt tried whistling and a few whistles came back from the leaves above. There was evidence of koalas though as many of the trees had been completely stripped of their bark which lay heaped at the base of the tree and spirals were marked on the trunk, possibly from their claws. 

Still we’d seen a real-life wild koala earlier so we were content.

By this time the sun had decided to come out of its shell completely and it had turned into a scorcher of a day. We soaked up the sun as best we could in our long trousers & trainers and sat on rocks watching the surfers & boogie-boarders enjoying the waves at Little Cove wishing we had more time in Noosa so that we could join them. Especially when leaving the beach we saw the temperature was a delightful 27°.

Well time to move on to the next place and Hervey Bay here we come. 

Today is a day for Australian animal spotting as we also saw a kangaroo today. And not just any kangaroo. No. It was Matilda, the 1982 Commonwealth Games mascot. There was an “interesting” story behind her current location. This was Matilda Roadhouse, a service station just north of Noosa. They started business in 1982 and had called themselves Matilda after the famous mascot. It took them 27 years exactly to buy her and another 16 months to restore her. I’m assuming to add the large medallion. I don’t know whether she already turned her head, wiggled her ears and winked an eye before her restoration but whoever thought of that is macabre. It is way too freaky.

Arrived at Hervey Bay “transit centre” surrounded by the usual McDonalds, KFC, Hungry Jacks (a rip-off of Burger King or the same company?), etc 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Possibly related to the Asian-style mode of driving our Greyhound driver adopted to get us from Noosa. You had to feel sorry for him though. The guy was obviously feeling poorly as he could hardly speak more than a squeak and it being school holidays it was Dad’s take your kids to work day so had two young kids sat on the front seats to keep in line with fizzy orange pop.

Our Friendly Hostel is like a mini house. 3 bedrooms per “unit” so there’s a maximum of 7 people to share the facilities with. A decent sized lounge and kitchen, a proper oven & a flat-screen TV. The only thing letting it down is it only has ONE toilet and ONE shower and they’re BOTH in the SAME room. WHY?
