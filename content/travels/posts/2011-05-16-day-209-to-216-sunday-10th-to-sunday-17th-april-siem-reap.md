We’re suffering from too much chill-out time, are feeling too de-stressed and need to take a break from the travelling so have come back to Siem Reap for three weeks off to work on [stolencamerafinder][1].

Only when we get here do we remember that the LP describes April in Cambodia as the “killer month”. They weren’t wrong. 

Sunday was hot. 

Monday was hotter. Blue skies, glaring sunshine. We had our 1st beer after 2 days dry since seeing Wend & Steve in Bangkok. It was essential to cool down.

Tuesday surprisingly was cooler. The clouds had arrived and it rained most of the day. We found a lovely new place for dinner called Hip Hop set in a garden of trees, fairylights and fountains. Very pretty. All of the locals were wearing a red item of clothing and heading to the very popular Hip Hop nightclub behind the restaurant. We think the red is related to the Khmer New Year this week.

Wednesday rainy all morning and then boiling at lunchtime. Not sure our fan room is going to cut it. Luckily the hotel has given us a fridge so plentiful supplies of Coca-Cola and Sprite have been purchased. We ventured to the old market and popped to a supermarket. The first supermarket trip in 7 months, the first sandwiches we had made ourselves in 7 months and a “night-in” in front of the telly. It’s the small things…

Thursday “**Chaul Chnam Thmey”** – Happy Khmer new year! The start of 3 days of celebrations of the Buddhist new year. Music playing everywhere, homes and shops with tables filled with offerings to Buddha

and covered with brightly coloured stars brimming with tinsel

This is a family time for Cambodians and Mr. Long has gone back to his family home miles away for a few days to see his small children, as do many of the local workers. So Siem Reap is unnaturally quiet. We end up in the least Cambodian part of Siem Reap. Pub St. Listening to live music and again drinking too many cheap half-pints of Anchor beer.

Friday is once again hot and we’re hungover from beerage. I contact SHAC – the Smiling Hearts Association for Children – as I’ve seen a poster about English teaching where we’re staying. As much as I like helping Matt with [stolencamerafinder][1] I think we may start to do each other’s head in if I spend 2 weeks sat in a room with him 24/7 and I really want to do something worthwhile myself. 

Saturday is a scorcher so we give in and opt for aircon at last. I visit SHAC about 1km from where we’re staying and love it. Aly who set up the charity is a local woman (and teacher) who has basically built a school&nbsp; and playground in her back garden. 100 kids of all ages come to learn English there. They are either orphaned, poor or have HIV/AIDS and cannot afford their own schooling without her help. It’s amazing. I start on Monday. Today was the climax for the new year. Next door had a huge party going on with dire Drum & Bass. Surreal.

Sunday it rained. Khmer New Year is celebrated to indicate the end of the dry season and the start of the rainy season. How right they were.
