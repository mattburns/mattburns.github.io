We saw the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge today. So excited! It didn’t seem real that we were actually in Sydney until we saw them. And it still doesn’t seem real now.

Stood looking the the Opera House for ages. The base of it is pretty ugly which consists of beige concrete and it is difficult to see the famous iconic shape of it from the bottom. But it doesn’t matter as you can get up close to the Swedish (? or Swiss?) tiles and see interesting shapes from all different angles. And you get a perfect full-on view of the Harbour Bridge from the end. And see the harbour waters from 3 sides. This was our first angle of SOH.

And another angle.

I was surprised how little people there were around the Opera House. It was relatively easy to get a photo without some random in it.

As you can imagine we took hundreds of photos from every angle of the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge and of both together. So I’ve only included our favourite favourites and follow this link for more photos of the same but slightly different …

And of course the obligatory silly photos of Karen by Matt.

Our second angle of SOH was from the water. We caught the ferry to Manly which meant a 180 degree water tour of the famous building. There you could glimpse the more familiar angles. Especially from our front of boat spot. Perfect positioning. Especially special when a pod of dolphins swam next to the boat which Matt spotted first.

This guy waved us off (he was making a fortune).

We arrived at Manly 30mins later (hadn’t realised that Sydney city was in such a cove) not really knowing what was there. We’d heard it was a good beach for surfing but we weren’t really up for that. It was bloomin’ freezing. So we went for the fish’n’chips on the beach option and just watched the surfers from afar whilst surrounded by carnivourous seagulls. I became a victim as I foolishly dropped my guard for a second and a seagull swooped in and nabbed some fish batter straight from my fingers. It was almost in my mouth and I felt its claws grab my hand. Cheeky bugger.

A wander around Manly found it to be a lovely seaside resort with sweet cafes and market stalls and an awful commercial main street of takeaways like Hungry Jacks and Subways. Everywhere is becoming the same. Still we manage to find a delightful cafe to try out the local caffeine and settle in for a while.

3 hours later we were back on the ferry and wandering around The Rocks taking more photos of SOH and SHB looking for that perfect shot which Matt found.

We also tried to find the way up to the bridge for sunset and failed so ended up with silly photos overlooking another part of the harbour instead.

Stumbled across the dying embers of the Rocks weekend market and had a quick nose around. I think Matt was relieved as most stalls had packed up for the night so I couldn’t buy anything. Looked like a pretty good market though. Will have to come back.

Didn’t take long before we were attracted to the Irish bar with its nice cold pints of Carlton Draught & live traditional Irish music. Then hunger set in and we happened across the Glenmore Hotel completely unintentionally.

It turns out they have a nice rooftop bar restaurant with rather spiffing views over the harbour (including from the urinals & one of the girls loos where the window was slightly ajar and sat down was perfect aligned). Couldn’t have planned it better.

And the moon decided to put in an appearance too.

What a spendiferous day.

_Extra bit – This photo believe it or not was taken just around the corner from the Harbour Bridge in The Rocks area. It’s a_ _little bit of Yorkshire in the centre of Sydney._![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/10/P10800931.jpg)
