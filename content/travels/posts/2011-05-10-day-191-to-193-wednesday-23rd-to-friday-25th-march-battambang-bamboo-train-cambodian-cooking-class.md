Yes I was right. Hangovers from hell. I think we went to sleep about 5am and were up and out in the midday sun packed and waiting for a bus to Battambang. Not pretty.

Luckily the bus journey to Battambang was a bearable 3.5 hours. And trusting a tuk-tuk driver (Mr Bat from Battambang) at the bus stop paid off. The first hotel was full (an LP recommendation) so ended up at its sister hotel Asia Hotel a bit further away but one of the best places we’ve stayed in for comfort and cleanliness and wifi and a steal at $8 a night.

Didn’t move for the rest of the day. Hangover took control. Like vampires we only ventured out after dark and only 100yards down the street to the nearest restaurant for dinner as once again the torrential rain and stormy weather appeared from nowhere. No matter we were the only occupants of the restaurant. Food was pleasant and we were in no mood for traipsing around.

Thursday I didn’t feel too good again which resulted in another non-eventful day apart from essential lunch & dinner. We did however get ripped off at the market where 4 oranges cost us $2 and we also found The Smoking Pot where they do cooking classes so may be doing that tomorrow. Hoping the weather will be better tomorrow too as pretty stormy again. 

Battambang has no real sights in town so no exciting photos I’m afraid. But it has a good ambience. It’s not too touristy yet. Has a real wholesome feeling. No fakeness like Siem Reap.

Friday we got active & tootled off with Mr Bat.

We “did” the bamboo train. Our attempt at negotiating with the “owner” of the bamboo train for a deal for 4 of us failed. It costs $5 per person regardless of how many people get on one train. We ended up deciding to go with another couple who were there trying to negotiate a price too. Our logic was that more people on one train would mean less petrol than two trains and save them money. 

Little did we know that the drivers only get paid the same ($1) whatever and the “owners” & police take the rest of the cash regardless of what we pay. So taking 2 may have been more beneficial to the drivers. 

The bamboo train is a quirky form of transport for locals. No passenger trains run in Cambodia at the moment so to get around the locals use bamboo platforms on double metal wheels (kind of like those ones you get in a kinder-egg or McDonalds happy meal to make a car) powered by small engines and pootle along the tracks between O Dambong and O Sra Lav.

There is only a single track so if you meet one coming the other way one of the “trains” is dismantled and rebuilt the other side.

We didn’t meet one on the way but did on the way back.

At O Sra Lav village we met Sherai and several kids who made us grass bracelets and rings. Sherai let us look around her brick making factory – comprising of a few thatched covered areas next to a clay pit and 2 large brick kilns.

We met this chap who was cutting the clay from the earth and piling it up ready to put in the brick mould.

We sat with Sherai and heard her story from Khmer Rouge times. She had been 8 years old when her parents and brother were taken away. Cut throats. Bound by hands and feet to a wooden pole and taken away never to be seen again. Tears welled in her eyes immediately. It was harrowing to listen to. And all she kept doing was apologising to us for her bad English (which was fine), weaving us grass crickets and feeding us fresh mango picked from the trees across the village. I tried to give her some money towards the mangoes and she wouldn’t take it saying give it to your driver.

We were only meant to spend 15mins there but it turned into 45mins. I could have stayed there for hours listening to her. So honest. I mean she must meet a lot of tourists. But unless she is as an excellent actress I cannot comprehend what she has been through. And I wish I understood it more. To both of us there seem so many unanswered questions about the 70s. How it all started. Why it happened. I mean it wasn’t that long after the Vietnam war and the American’s bombing half of Cambodia (killing 600k) & Laos (killing 100k).

On our way back we met an oncoming bamboo train so the opposition surrendered and swapped their platform to the track behind us.

Off one-side

Back on the other

Back at the embarking station we gave the driver a tip to help with his measly $1 wage and then heard the story that the “owners” are in fact 40 families in that village that rotate each day. All income is split between these families. The police are involved. As always in Cambodia. But perhaps everyone is fighting to survive. I don’t doubt that people from each village sees it as a con. It’s all a con. But it seems that everyone is out to get as much as possible from the tourists because that’s all they can get.

Next stop was Phnom Sampeau. Mr Bat became our impromptu guide walking with us up this superficial looking hill smack in the middle of the flattest land we’ve ever seen. This lump of limestone seemed unnatural. Mr Bat explained that most of this area of Cambodia used to be part of the sea hence the flatness. But why this random hill and a second one in the distance but none others to speak off for miles around? No-one knows.

The Wat had been turned into a prison by the Khmer Rouge and then back into a Wat afterwards. Men were currently re-painting it with vivid depictions of Buddhist stories. 

The Killing Caves were both spectacular and harrowing. These huge natural caves on top of a hill with steps going down into them built by monks to lead to shrines had been turned into a place of death by the Khmer Rouge. A hole in the top was where KR soldiers beat over the head and pushed their victims into the cave below. A glass cabinet displayed some skulls from victims there. An old German/Russian gun bought by the Cambodian government still lies at the top of the hill too where it was used to fire at the Khmer Rouge.

The Killing Caves

Nearby a ginormous Buddha head is partially carved into the side of the hill. The project ran out of money before it was finished. It looks like he’s been buried in the rock and can’t get out. (We missed the photo opportunity here so just imagine).

Now that was just the morning. We managed to get back in time for our afternoon Cambodian cooking class at the Smoking Pot.

A truly authentic trip to the market where we actually bought what we were going to cook.

Snake fish (we think) that one minute were splashing about in a washing up bowl were slapped on a scales, then onto a chopping board, whacked over the head with the back of a cleaver, skinned, gutted and filleted and placed in a plastic bag. The bloodied heads were also retrieved and kept to be carried by yours truly back to the restaurant to be used for stock. Yum yum.

At least ours were definitely dead. A nearby fishmonger had a skinned fish on a board that was still moving.

Made Beef Loklak, Fish Amok and Chicken & Lemongrass soup. All delicious. Perhaps too many bird-shit chillies (this is what birds-eye chillies are really called as the seeds are eaten by birds and grow in their droppings) in the soup which I almost choked on but lovely all the same. Also amazing cookbook with so much useful info about fresh ingredients. Can’t wait to get home and start cooking! (Well after New Zealand and Australia of course :) Such a bargain cooking class for $8. Especially as there were only 4 of us in the class. Highly recommend it if you’re ever in Battambang.

Off to Bangkok tomorrow via the infamous Poipet border crossing.
