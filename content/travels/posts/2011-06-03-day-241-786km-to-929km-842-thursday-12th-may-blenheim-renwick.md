Another glorious day to wake up to. The van was like a greenhouse. Lovely waking up being all toasty.

I ran across the railway line and along the beachside for a different perspective of Okiwi Bay. After yesterday’s walk the legs were a tad sore but it feels good to actually be active again (even if it is only for 10mins each day).

Our drive took us north to Blenheim in Marlborough County. The scenery changed from mountainous and rocky to hilly green pastures of a Teletubby land look to acres and acres of flat land covered in vines. We are in Wine Country. Where one of our favourite Sauvignon Blancs are produced by Oyster Bay (introduced to us by Dulcie & Ben on our visit to Vancouver a few years ago).

We plan to hire a tandem tomorrow and tour the local wineries. There are a number of places to stay in Blenheim and hire bikes but we want to take a tandem from Renwick 10km away so we check out the Old Mill B&B tandem hire. He’s a sweet guy who says just turn up tomorrow. There are no campsites in Renwick but Old Mill guy recommends we ask at the olde English pub the Cork & Keg. And it’s a corker. They’re fine with us parking up out back and they serve good ale. 3 pints of Golden Lager for me and Speights for Matt later we roll into the van outside. How perfect is that?
