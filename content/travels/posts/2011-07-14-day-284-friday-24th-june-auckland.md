Another day in Auckland. Another cancelled flight tomorrow. Booked in for Sunday evening.

Qantas will pay for 3 nights accommodation so Sunday will be good for us üòÄ

There is nothing to complain about at [Hotel deBrett](https://hoteldebrett.com/). The breakfast was divine. Fresh fruit, proper coffee and delicious pastries. Pre-dinner drinks in the Drawing Room were proper drinks. I sound so common but most ‚Äúfree‚Äù drinks in hotels are usually the cheapest most generic thing they can think of. The Drawing Room itself, I wish we could have picked up and taken home with us. Retro cool. To get an idea here is the chair in the foyer that I wanted to smuggle into my backpack.

Tried the delights of Velvet Burger, very GBK-like, and stumbled across a lovely bar called The Library, unsurprisingly filled to the rafters with books, sofas & armchairs. And not a lot else today.
