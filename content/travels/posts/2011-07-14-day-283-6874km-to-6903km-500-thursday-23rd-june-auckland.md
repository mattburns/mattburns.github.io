Bye bye New Zealand in a campervanâ€¦

![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P1070580.jpg)

â€¦hello New Zealand in a beautiful hotel.

So weâ€™re meant to be in Sydney now but instead weâ€™re in a gorgeous hotel in the centre of Auckland. 

Qantas told us we have a budget of $250 AUD to spend on accommodation per day so weâ€™ve booked ourselves into the best hotel in central Auckland. Well why not?!

After taking a couple of wrong turns and ending up on the motorway and then back where we started we finally made it to Wilderness where they were happy with everything weâ€™d paid for for the vanâ€™s bump previously and we had no other costs to pay. Plus instead of driving us 5 mins down the road to the airport as weâ€™d originally planned, Steve drove us back into the centre of Auckland and dropped us off right outside the hotel. Couldnâ€™t have asked for better customer service. UK companies could definitely learn from the rest of the world.

Hotel deBrett is gorgeous. Itâ€™s definitely the best hotel Iâ€™ve ever been in. The bed is a giant marshmallow. The bathroom is bigger than our van. And it has a bathtub. Bliss. The staff are lovely too. Matt will vouch for that. Most of them are pretty European ladies ðŸ˜‰.

All Qantas flights in and out of NZ are cancelled again today so weâ€™re now flying out Saturday.

We donâ€™t mind being stranded in Auckland.
