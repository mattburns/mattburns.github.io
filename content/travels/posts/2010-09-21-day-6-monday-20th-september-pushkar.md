7am wakeup calls from the market traders and motorbikes in the street below didn’t deter us from the first lie-in in a while. Good old ear plugs. 11 o’clock we rolled into the Sadar Bazaar and mooched up the street looking for Laxmi market.

Accosted by Gutar in Navjyoti Tailors he successfully flogged us some new traveller styley clothes so we can start to blend in more. All Matt needs now is a tan and he’d look the part.
  
Not sure why we bought from him as he asked “Do you dye your hair?”. Yes i said thinking he meant the black. “You dye it white?” he said. No that is grey hair! Roots are pretty bad already!!

Found a lovely cafe called Honey & Spice which serves good wholesome hippy food. Toast with rose jam which looked like chutney but tasted like honey and turkish delight. Absolutely delicious. More toast covered with tofu pate with basil and fenugreek sprouts (which look like mini beansprouts) and a pasta salad. Topped off with a cinnamon and ginger coffee. Really yummy!

Spent a couple of hours in our first internet cafe as nowhere in Pushkar has wifi. No wireless networks to be found and internet is advertised as 256kbps. Matt loved this geeky fact.
  
I do too because it sums up Pushkar. Slow and easy and chilled. Just need to ween myself off the blogging now to give everyone some peace and quiet and get me away completely from technology. An indian head massage or reflexology session tomorrow should help :)

Dinner at Sunset Cafe to the East if the lake and overlooking one of the ghats was again a beautiful sight that cannot be described well enough. The sky turned a thousand colours as the drums beat a tune and the pilgrims bathed in the lake.
  
My only gripe today is the mozzies. We came under attack whilst eating dinner so ankles and feet are more unattractive than normal.
