It’s raining. Quick trip to Spencer Beach to see the sea & sand minus sun.

Found the Department of Conservation (DOC) centre after our 2nd attempt to arm ourselves with a list of the DOC campsites across New Zealand which are much cheaper than commercial sites or even free.

Went in search of the first motorhome dumpstation getting lost a couple of times circling&nbsp; Christchurch. The not so glorious side of campervanning is getting rid of waste water and filling up with new water. We decided to only fill up clean water and leave the rest as we were sure it couldn’t be full yet. I found out that I shouldn’t trust Matt with the tap end of a hosepipe. Apparently he was just wondering what would happen if he turned it on full blast. He now knows that it drenches the person stood at the other end.

Today was the day for getting lost. We tried four different roads to find our first DOC site at Grey River in Ashley Forest. No such luck and when it was almost dark gave up, found Wooded Gully in Mt Thomas Forest instead and parked up in the middle of a grassy muddy field with 2 more campervans and settled in for the night.
