Still in Alleppey. Matt is over the flu symptoms but has Delhi belly all over again. You’re meant to get it in the first 2 weeks of being in India not the last 2 weeks as well.

So decided it was best to stay put for another day as he can’t travel that far and get some antibiotics. We think we have some. Had to check it on wikipedia though ;)

Running out of things to occupy myself with…. And poor Matt is “boreder” than bored.
