Tuesday we had our second surf lesson. The water was calmer and the boards were slipperier and we just couldn’t stand up. We are obviously much better in rougher waves. We blame the boards. Still it was fun stuff and we went back on Wednesday for another lesson. This time there were too many people so we just hired our own boards and wetsuits and headed to the beach. We were still pretty terrible but we won’t give up!

Chilled out for the rest of the day at the beach and the hostel. The hostel is one of those places you could stay for indefinitely. We loved the meditation area for drinking coffee in peace…![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_8590.jpg)

and the bar-b-q (so did the dogs)

and the campfire.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P1070783.jpg)

The pool looked pretty inviting too but it was too chilly to venture into.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P1070785.jpg)

On Thursday afternoon we realised we hadn’t got round to seeing the famous Town of 1770 yet so went to borrow the free bikes at the hostel. Unfortunately they were all out of service due to being completely knackered so we jumped on the shuttle bus into Agnes to think of what to do next. And what did Matt spot at the bus stop? Electric bikes. We went for the 1-hour hire to do a 14km round trip. Could we make it?

Of course we could, we were on bicycles with magic powers. We glided up the steep hills without any puffing & panting and reached the tip of 1770 effortlessly.

With the clock ticking though we only had a quick stop for a couple of photos and for Matt to almost run over a kangaroo. Yes I did say KANGAROO! We saw an actual live one and he bounced off back into the bush.

Whizzed back to Agnes Water and were there with seconds to spare. We both want electric bikes now!

Ended a lovely day with a luvverly bag of chips on the beach bought from a chippie run by an old guy from Stafford. We watched him bamboozle some Aussie kids by trying to entertain them with a guess the name of the plastic fish on a spring. “Bob” he chuckled. They didn’t really get it but we appreciated his corny British humour.
