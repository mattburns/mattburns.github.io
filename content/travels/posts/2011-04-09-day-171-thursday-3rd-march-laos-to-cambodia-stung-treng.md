After 6 weeks in Laos, we’re now in Cambodia!!

There’s Laos time and there’s snail time. It took us 5 hours to go approx 70km from Don Det to Stung Treng.

8am boat ride from Don Det to the mainland followed by a long wait on a dusty street outside a makeshift travel shop until 10am and we board a bus. Half hour or so later we’re at the Laos/Cambodia border. The bus guy says he can do our visas for us to save us getting off the bus and its quicker. Hmmm well it meant we didn’t have to move our bags off and back on like most people we saw but we were still there for over an hour and half.

We passed through “quarantine” – the bus wheels were sprayed and [Sulu][1] came on the bus and pointed a radar gun at everyone’s heads before leaving satisfied. We were going back to the future.

Less than an hour later we were in bland unkempt Stung Treng. It seemed less clean than Laos. There was rubbish all over the streets and it was extremely dusty. The change in temperature felt extreme too. It was suddenly absolutely bloody boiling. But saying that our 5 dollar room was clean and we’re only staying one night so we can get the bus to Ban Lung tomorrow.
