Matt has promised to add some photos soon to help make this blog more interesting! (he says see [flickr][1] :) )

Had enough of the bugs and electricity cuts and dirty walls in Hotel Sanjay so we’ve moved to a quieter part of town to Hotel Rising Star. Only 300 rupees a night (£4.20) and its so much cleaner and lovelier than being on Sadar Bazaar.
  
No views of the lake but we’re not that far away and in a cluster of other hotels recommended by LP. We have a views of the tops of higgledy piggledy blue buildings with a large tree in the middle which is home to green parakeets and chipmunks. No sign of any macaques yet but the owner has warned us not to leave the door open when we leave in case of unwanted visitors!
  
I can currently here cows mooing more loudly than beeping traffic :)

Tasted the best banana bread ever. Don’t know how they make it without eggs.
