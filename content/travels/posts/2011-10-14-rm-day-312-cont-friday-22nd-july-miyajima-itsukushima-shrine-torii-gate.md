After such a sobering morning we needed a lighter afternoon.

A tram, train & ferry trip later and we were on Miyajima island, home of the Itsukushima Shrine, its famous floating torii gate and countless tame wild deer always looking for food.

It’s a pretty little place with a coastal promenade and one street of cute little shops that even the deer fancied popping into for some retail therapy.

At the end of the promenade you get a full view of the torii gate. Well as full as can be if you imagine no-one and no-deer there.

It was a very cool structure. We had heard you needed to go for high tide to get the reflection and for low tide to be able to walk out to it. We thought we’d missed both. Fortune cookies were again on our side and as we spent the whole afternoon there we were able to see both, more or less.

So hold onto your hats this is going to be a Sydney opera house/harbour bridge type blog with hundreds of photos of the same structure but from a squillion different angles / with different features.

Funny photo, haha.

The pagoda on the hill before entering the shrine.

The shrine is also pretty funky and is built over the water.

No torii gate on this one but he is a cool dude.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_9283.jpg)

Once we’d exhausted looking at the shrine and the torii gate in daylight we manoeuvred ourselves into the blind-covered Omotesando street to seek out sustenance in the form of bar-b-q oysters and a rice burger – rice instead of bread for the burger bun. That was fun trying to eat without falling apart.

And no shopping street in Japan is worth its salt without a Hello Kitty store where I took pleasure browsing through the Hello Kitty watches, Hello Kitty mobile phone charms, Hello Kitty socks, Hello Kitty notebooks, Hello Kitty flasks, Hello Kitty table covers, Hello Kitty in Sesame Street costumes, Hello Kitty with Miyajima deer, Hello Kitty & the torii gate etc, etc whilst Matt squirmed to get out of there.

This was my penalty for making him spend so long in there.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/10/P1080394.jpg)

And this is my revenge for making me kiss a giant plastic Hello Kitty. Matt with the World’s largest spatula (Miyajima is famous for its wooden rice scoops).

Another revenge, haha! Unbeknownst to Mr. Burns I caught this rather camp photo with my recent purchase as he day-dreamed about beer.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/10/P1080375.jpg)

A deer later took a fancy to that same fan and almost ate it whilst we sat watching the sunset over the torii gate. The deer have a keen taste for paper so you are warned by large signs as you exit the ferry terminal to keep all paper articles concealed, especially tickets and passports, as the residents have a knack of pickpocketing important documents when your back is turned.

We stayed long enough to watch the sun disappear over the hills of mainland Japan and very pretty and relaxing it was too.

By the time the sun was gone and we had to start walking back to the ferry to catch one of the last ones to the mainland the water had more or less disappeared from under the torii gate leaving it a little sad seeped in seaweedy mud.

Back in Hiroshima we hunted down more Okonomiyaki and had an early night in preparation for our journey up to Kyoto tomorrow.
