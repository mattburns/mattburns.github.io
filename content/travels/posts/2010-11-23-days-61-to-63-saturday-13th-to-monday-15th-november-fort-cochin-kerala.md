Saturday morning legged it from Seashore Residency and ended up in Elite Hotel on the main high street which is much much nicer. They had FOUR towels laid out on the bed without us even asking. And plenty of natural light. And no psycho bloke at the desk.

Wandered to Mantancherry on the other side of the island to Fort Cochin where I could have spent an absolute fortune. So many shops selling gorgeous jewellery, pashminas, cushion covers, ornaments you don’t need etc etc. Managed to avoid buying anything.&nbsp; 

Later as we were off out for dinner who did we spot checking into our hotel? The New Zealand couple Isla & Neil whom we’d met in Delhi half-checking in then checking out of Smyle Inn and then bumped into in Chowrasta (the main square) in Darjeeling. What are the chances?

We went for a beer with them and ended up rolling into our room at about 3 or 4 this morning after far too much beer and rum & coke and no food. Somehow we slept until 2pm when we had to check 3 different clocks to believe it really was that late. Haven’t had a hangover in 2 months and now we both remember why they are BAD! I don’t think our bodies will forgive us for a long time. I’m sure my liver was just starting to repair itself! 

So Sunday was a write-off and we only managed to get out for lunch briefly at the lovely Kashi Art Cafe with proper fresh tuna & cheese melts & good strong coffee. Felt more human in the evening and after attempting 3 different restaurants that were either closed or not serving dinner we ended up back in Teapot for roast chicken & roast potatoes, Keralan style. The closest we have had to a Sunday roast in a long time. 

Monday we met Isla & Neil for brekkie and then braved the ferry queue, which surprisingly were two orderly ones, a men’s and a women’s. Not sure I’ve mentioned that before. Pretty much all queues are split by gender usually with only one person serving both queues alternately. Again the ladies was shorter so I got to queue in the heat and have the same problem again with 2 and 3. The guy once again thought I asked for 3 tickets. Why would I ask for 3 tickets when it quite blatantly says maximum 2 tickets per person all over the ticket booth? I really need to learn English before I can even think about teaching it!

The queuing system evaporated after the ticket booth and it was a free-for-all to get onto the ferry. How my backpack is still in my possession in one piece I’ll never know. I thought my hand was going to get dragged away with it too.

Back in Ernakulum we headed for Excellency Hotel nearish the station. It looked a bit posh for us but LP had recommended it and we didn’t mind paying a bit extra for one night. I think the receptionist took one look at this sweaty pair of scruffy backpackers and claimed they were full. Well we had that for another hour. Although most of the places were dives they were all full. Seemed a bit fishy to me. I think we were in more of a locals area than touristy place. Eventually found Shalimar Residency, a rip-off at 900 rupees but it was another Pushpak style hotel (Kolkata) and did the job. It had a TV. And was 5 mins walk from Pizza Hut and the station so couldn’t complain.

Never guess where we had dinner then. Yep another round of pizza & garlic bread. Followed by an hour of traipsing round shoes shops to find the magical pair of sandals that only exist in Matt’s head and no-one has manufactured yet. He must have tried on at least 20 different sandals, flip-flops, slip-ons, leather, plastic, you name it. At one point a shop assistant suggested a pair and Matt asked for something “more masculine”. I believe I have seen many Indian guys wearing that exact style! 

Still Matt’s refusing to budge until he finds his glass slipper and in the meantime is plodding on in a 4-year pair of flip-flops that are thinner than cardboard and probably giving years of back trouble to come. It will be front-page news when he finally gets some. Which will be when the current ones fall apart completely.

Not sure he’s going to like me for blogging about his footwear issue.
