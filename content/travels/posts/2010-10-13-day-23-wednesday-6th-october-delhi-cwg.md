Day 2 in Delhi – The inefficiencies

We pop by Smyle Inn to ask about the room. Yes it will be ready later. Come back at noon. Ok so merrily we go off to get brekkie @ Sam’s Cafe. I won’t even go into that…

Back at 12 and the guy is oh i’m sorry we still have no room. do you mind staying at the other hotel another night? Um yes we do bloody mind mate. He starts throwing free cartons of juice at us to placate us. And you should have come for free breakfast he said. Sod the bloody breakfast where is our room? So off in a huff we go to HUI and cunningly ask the guy how much our room is. He struggles to say immediately but blurts our 450 rupees. Why that little \*&%\*!! was charging us 690 per night. What a scammer. So with some confrontation from the Smyle Inn and protests of well you get free internet and breakfast blah blah blah, we officially moved ourselves from Smyle Inn to Unique International and paid 450 per night direct rather than via a middleman. 

Anyway enough about hotels and all that boring stuff. We came back to Delhi for a reason – the Commonwealth Games (CWG)!
  
Well what can we say. The metro was good. Got there fine. 4.15 and the games were due to start at 5.30 so plenty of time to find a seat. Went through the main gate easy. Got to security no problem except for Matt had a 5 rupee coin in his pocket. No coins allowed. They’re a hazard. Need to throw it away. Where’s the charity box matt asks. No charity box, need to bin. Matt doesn’t want to leave his camera as it’s already gone through the scanners and he hasn’t but he has to go back to the bin. Dilemma. So he throws the coin at the bin and bingo scores! Matt’s highlight of the trip so far ;)

We find our block A29 and it’s empty. Not a soul. So we head to get some food. There is one food place for the whole of A block. It is a room with 2 tables. Behind one table is one guy taking orders and money. This guy then shouts the order across to the 3 guys stood behind the second table and between them they get the bottle out of the fridge and/or the pre-wrapped food off the shelf.
  
Not surprisingly this system isn’t working too well and the queue although not that long at this point is taking a while. We finally get to the front and order our food. Sorry no food. Come back in 15-20 mins. Great all that for a bottle of coke.
  
So off back to A29 with our coke. Sorry sir you can’t take food and drink to your seats. You have to stay here. So we loiter at the top of the block with our coke. 20mins later off we trot back to the food place. This time there are 20 people in front of us. The queue is snaking around the room. The same system is in place. It’s a joke. It takes us 25mins to get 2 veggie burgers (we wanted wraps – there were none only veggie burgers) and a water. By that time the games are just about to start. But we have to eat at the top of the block. Lucky there were only about 10 people in total in A29 so we could still sit anywhere.
  
Half the stadium is empty. It’s bizarre. We are sat on the opposite side to the 100m track so can hardly see anything going on on that side. Plus all the blocks on the other side are practically empty too. Very very bizarre.

We also stayed til the bitter end to see the medal ceremonies and we were literally the last people to leave!

I won’t even go into the palava it took to get back with the metro where 100 times the number of people that could fit pushed their way onto a train without letting anyone off. Absolutely ridiculous.

Just one last thing – the 5000m -the reason for going to the CWG (to see Mo Farah though he pulled out) was a really good event!
