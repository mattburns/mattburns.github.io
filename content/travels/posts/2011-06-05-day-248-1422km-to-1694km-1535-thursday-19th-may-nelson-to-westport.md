_1422 to 1531km_

Left the Nelson I-Site carpark early again to land at Lake Rotoroa for brekkie overlooking lake & mountains.

_1532 to 1694km_

The road to Westport through Buller’s Gorge was another impressive route.

Stopped off at “Buller’s Swingbridge”. The longest swingbridge in NZ. You pay $5 to cross it and can pay lots more to take a “Flying Fox” back across. The wire swingbridge is across a wide river full of rapids and is quite good. The walk around the old gold-mining area is boring. The Flying Fox to us looked like a waste of money and too home-made. The ziplines at home in Go Ape I think are more exhilarating.

Interesting fact near the swingbridge.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/06/P1060534.jpg)

Westport was rainy so found the local brewery West Coast Brewery Co and stopped by for some tastings. No tour involved. You sit on cushion-padded beer barrels huddled around a larger barrel-table having a hard job keeping warm with the guy who pours the beers and tasted 7 beers. We had the added company of a couple of entertaining Irish lads on a world tour. Left with 2 litres of Pale Ale and 2 litres of Black Lager. Both freshly poured into plastic bottles. Good old-fashioned breweries are the best. Who needs a tour?
