Rock-climbing in Railay is (apologies for americanism here but it needs to be used) awesome. Would definitely recommend it to anyone. I’ve never really climbed outdoors before and it is is completely different to indoors. I managed to do 4.5 climbs and Matt did 6. The weather couldn’t have been better. It was dry but overcast whereas later it rained and since then it’s been sweltering.

Looked around lots of accommodation and most of it is too expensive except for some lovely bungalows next to where we’re staying so we’ll go back tomorrow.

We have discovered coconut shakes. Coconut milk mixed with ice and water into a big cup full of coconutty frothy goodness. Yummy!
