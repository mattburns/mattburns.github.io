Arrived in Noosa after a pleasant Greyhound trip to find the sun ablazing. Yahoo!

As everyone else moved off into their designated pickup mini-buses, we being the usual turn up and see, decided on the YHA for its closest proximity to the bus stop (we now seem to be carting around a total of 6 bags – 2 backpacks, 2 rucksacks, 1 bag of souvenirs and a coolbag) and turns out the lovely Noosa Heads beach.

Halse Lodge YHA is a gorgeous old-looking wooden structured building with a veranda around the first floor covered in cushion-strewn sofas & armchairs. They have a large communal area with pool table, footy table (Matt is happy) and ping-pong table plus a licensed bar and an outdoor area covered in wooden tables & chairs.

Our room is a sweet sizeable place with natural wooden floors, wooden bed-side tables and old criss-cross wooden windows with the quirky addition of bars with catflaps to enable you to reach the latches. Not that it matters as they are warped so don’t shut properly. No matter, we like the place instantly.

A walk along the beach and main street finds that Noosa is a holiday destination for backpackers and rich people. We find a shop with a sale of 70% off and the clothes are still too expensive for us. Our lunch is a shared Subway $7 footlong. The cheapest food we could find. 

Later that day whilst Matt climbed his way up through the rankings of Wednesday night’s “foosball” competition I chatted to a group of girls from Rugby. They were all just about to head off to uni and I enquired with one which course she was doing. “Criminology” was the reply. “Sounds interesting”, I replied, “I love all the psychological stuff. Did you ever see Cracker?” A blank face looked back at me. “You know that one with Robbie Coltrane in it.” Still a blank face. “The guy who is Hagrid in Harry Potter?” Suddenly there were signs of recognition and a reply “Oh yes I know who Hagrid is”. 

There endeth the conversation as the realisation hit that my hair is old and my face is young but my hair (and knowledge of 90s TV) tells the truth!

Forgetting all that, back to Matt. After a grilling combat and good defence, plus an over-egotistical American shouting “Who loves me?” over and over, Matt came 3rd. Then defaulted to 2nd as the aforementioned American defaulted by being a member of staff. That meant a good win of $10 to spend at the bar. A free bowl of nachos became our dinner. And lovely they were too. Food always tastes better when it’s free. The beers on the other hand weren’t free but tasted just as good anyway.
