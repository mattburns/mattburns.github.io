Didn’t get very far today. The plan had been to see Tauranga in the morning and start heading up to Coromandel this afternoon. We’re still in Tauranga.

Started off at the art gallery for a bit of culture. It was very nice. 

Stopped for a yummy coffee & delicious home-baked sausage roll at the Dry Dock Cafe where we chatted to the owner who has inspired me even more to run my own business.&nbsp; 

Went back on ourselves to go to Mt Mauranga beach. It was very lovely.

We’re running out of new ideas and so had fish & chips by the sea again. At least the view had changed.

Now camping in the Marina carpark in Tauranga. We go to all the best places.
