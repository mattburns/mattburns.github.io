Finally escaped the hospital at 11:00, Matt armed with prescription for more drugs we headed for trusted Margao Residency, our bland business Goa hotel. 

Matt didn’t know what to do. Fresh air. No nurses. No stuff being pumped into his arm. Weird concept. He is much better which is good as we don’t want to go back to hospital any time soon – even if it was cheaper than the hotel and had larger rooms.

I gave him a short tour of Margao – the counter where I bought our cups of rose tea, the posh Bread & More shop with the crusty rolls, the market where I bought the veg, the guy selling disco mirrorballs next to the fruit&veg guy outside the petrol station, the airtel man and the shop that supplied the laughing cow cheese. What a fun few days I’d had.

Popped by Anita’s of course to say thanks with a bunch of gerberas. I think she appreciated them. 

Faffed about in Margao the whole day really. Nowt exciting to tell I’m afraid. Off to Hampi tomorrow so hopefully for everyone’s sanity that will be more exciting.
