Brekkie today was in our own private holiday park with a backdrop of forested hills and snowy mountains.

Mostly a day of working on [SCF][2] in the campervan sat outside a nearby backpackers lodge which had wifi with our chosen provider. We are very sad. But hey there’s work to be done.

A whistle-stop trip to Fox Glacier. It was cold and rainy and low cloud cloaked the hills. Very a la Misty Mountains. How a couple of hours can make such a difference in weather conditions. We ventured halfway to the bottom of Fox Glacier to get a satisfactory glance at the flowing ice river.

So similar to Franz Josef we double-backed pretty sharpish and were on our way south to our campsite next to Lake Paringa. 

Actually managed to arrive before dark so for once we were able to select the most desirable location overlooking the lake. Just hope the lake levels don’t rise overnight.

Evening of listening to the rain and watching episodes of Big Bang Theory.
