A taxi took us to our over-priced hotel Cowie’s in Walton Street. We don’t know what that place is trying to be but it’s not getting enough right. And everyone who works there expects tips for nothing. We had 4 of us in a tiny lift plus our backpacks because 2 guys felt the need to help us to our room! Can’t complain about the location though. It’s about 10mins from Gateway of India and Taj Hotel. 

The main road near by is full of market stalls selling beautiful jewellery, scarves, sunglasses and clocks. The market stalls further up town near the university weren’t so classy and I can’t even mention some of the “ladies items” they had on display. 

Spent the day doing the walking tour suggested by LP which took us from Gateway of India, past Chhatrrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (Prince of Wales museum) which was a beautiful domed building in large grounds full of palm trees, down to Horniman Circle, a park with a very bizarre fountain which has a crocodile statue at the bottom of it and real ducks plodding on its head. Luckily for Matt that route also took us past an electronics shop called Croma so our bags are now heavier with blank DVDs, an external hard drive and a mini laptop mouse. I think we spent more time in that shop than we did looking at any historical buildings in Mumbai. Once I’d dragged Matt from Croma, we headed past Flora Fountain to the Oval Maidan, a large grass area where at least 5 proper cricket matches were being played.

Later wandered to the main train station to have a nose at that. Was pretty impressive building but Matt was more impressed with the endless camera shops opposite and the SLR is now slightly heavier with its new UV filter accessory.

We were accosted by some business studies students who had to make as much money as possible from their 1 rupee coffee sweet. Matt made them do a proper sales pitch and lucky for them they did well and ended up with 6 rupees :) 

Bear in mind Mumbai is 440 sq km and has a population of 16.4 million and who did we bump into on a random street on the way back to the hotel? Uli from the Darjeeling to Kolkata leg. Teeny world really.
