Bungalows next door are booked up so we’ve resigned ourselves to staying at Railay Cabana for 2 more nights. I am now prepared for cockroaches. And the small green frog in the bathroom was more cute than scary.&nbsp; Although Matt reminded me today to shake towels and clothing before using them in case you come across an unwanted inhabitant. He didn’t tell me what he found in his towel after a shower and I don’t want to know…

Went exploring to find the famous Hat Phranang, one of the top beaches in Thailand according to LP. And it was beautiful. Even the walk there was fascinating. There is a path that winds along the side of and underneath a huge rock where giant stalactites and stalagmites have formed and the trees are so tall you can’t see the top and branches hanging down are higher than houses.&nbsp;

Phranang beach itself is a curve of gorgeous yellow sands and crystal clear water with views of more limestone karsts jutting out of the sea and longtails floating around

We sat on the beach with a can of Chang, bought from a random Thai guy with a carrier-bag of ice & beer, until the rains came and we were forced to sprint back to the shelter of the stalactites and then the 15min walk back up to Railay Cabana to get ready for new year.

I wore my new dress at last! And we headed down to YaYa bar for a delicious cocktail and then to Skunk Bar in Railay East for more cocktails, free kebab, free bodypaint and a freaky persian cat that didn’t seem to mind being picked up by some Italians and danced with on the table.

At 11:45 the place was practically empty and we were starting to think we were missing something. It was almost bong time and where was everyone? Luckily Matt asked a group who were heading out the door where they were off to and they said Railay West beach for the new year celebrations. Shit! We had to get a move on. Railay West Beach was a good 10mins away in daylight and with normal clothes on. In a dress and super-thin flipflops at nearly midnight it was going to be a challenge. We absolutely legged it from Skunk Bar to the west and somehow we managed to make it with 1min to spare – just enough time to buy a beer. Ah this was where everyone was. The beach was packed with people and at midnight the whole place exploded with fireworks and chinese lanterns and music. Wonderful.

Back to Railay East and to Last Bar, literally the last bar on the strip, and they have a big raised platform on stilts over the water with floor cushions. We found ourselves a nice little table to sit at and when we’d drunk enough we danced the night away until 3:30am when Matt realised it was time to go back [_Karen suddenly found a level of drunkness so new they haven’t got a word for it yet. -ed_]. Stupidly I accidentally dropped my bag and the contents of it on a dark pathway on the way home and although we found the contents we couldn’t find the bag. So once we’d got back Matt in his tipsy state ran all the way back with a torch and found the bag. How sweet is that. (A shame it was split beyond repair but it’s the thought that counts :)

So when we were tucked up fast asleep in bed the UK celebrated New Year.&nbsp; 

End of 2010, a year of new experiences, what will 2011 bring….

Happy New Year!
