So this is where we camped last night.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/06/P1060975.jpg)

Our jamminess ran out today. Weather was extremely RUBBISH for going to Milford Sound. Rain & fog are not conducive to picturesque views across sea and mountains. But hey you can’t win ‘em all.

The drive to Milford Sound was pretty spectacular despite the sh*tty weather. You could still get the gist of it and there were definitely Misty Mountains galore.

The most exciting bit of the trip there was the 1km tunnel bored straight through a mountain which was practically pitch black and coming out of the other end into the light you were faced with a sheer drop surrounded by overbearing mountains and an Italian-countryside-Formula-one-esque hairpin road downwards. Wow.

This is a terrible photo as the road atlas is reflected in the windscreen but I wanted to remember the tunnel!![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/06/P1070007.jpg)

Out the other side (does not do it justice).![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/06/P1070014.jpg)

Milford Sound itself was also still impressive even though it was hardly visible and extremely drizzly.

After crossing our fingers and toes for an hour or so hoping that the rain would stop it worsened and became mistier so we made the decision to head back to Te Anau to get a head start for tomorrow.

This time we stopped at all the lookouts and touristy type areas. The Chasm was the first. Having no idea what it was we were astounded by this monster of a waterfall that we could hear thundering ages before we reached it. Our blood pressure definitely increased as we approached the walkway which passes directly above it. 

We’d stopped at the Mirror Lakes on the way but they weren’t as interesting as they were on the way back. The skies had started clearing here and there were no bus loads of tourists stomping by. Just us two.

Now at another one of the DOC sites called Mackay Creek parked precariously on a riverbank with trees along one side and mountains the other with snow on one or two.

Watching Lord of the Rings to try and spot places we’ve seen. Forgotten how cheesy it is. Also watching it made me realise how much Harry Potter is LOTR. Long-bearded wizards, an annoying small boy wearing round spectacles, a quest to kill an evil lord whose spirit didn’t die when his body did so is becoming stronger all the time and will eventually take a life-form who recruits people to become evil black faceless creatures that try to kill the boy, being able to see the past in pools of water, blah blah blah.

_Note to self: add waterfall video & Matt’s timelapse when back to the real world_
