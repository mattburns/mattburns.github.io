1097km to 1164km Nelson to Marahau

Sometimes we can be so jammy. We left Nelson at 8:10 to go to Marahau not knowing how long it would take hoping we could get the 9:30 Aqua taxi to Anchorage to do a 4 hour walk along the coast of the Abel Tasman National Park. We arrived in their car park at 9:15, Matt bought the last 2 tickets whilst I stuffed our bags with warm clothing, waterproofs and random food for the trip and jumped straight on the boat (on the back of a tractor/trailer) into the best seats.

What a ride. They took us down the coast to see Split Apple Rock. I can’t remember the story behind it so will have to let Matt write it or not bother. [_I can’t remember either. Moral was about some demi-gods that couldn’t share – Ed_]

And we saw a pod of dolphins! Topped the Irawaddy dolphins in Cambodia.

To top it off we stepped off the boat into paradise. The skies were blue, the sun was blooming and we felt sun-kissed for the first time since arriving in NZ.

There is nothing like being bare-foot on sandy beach and paddling in a calm clear turquoise sea. The beach was practically deserted. Only one other couple disembarked at Anchorage Bay and 3 yachts bobbed around in the bay. There was no-one else.

We ate a weird brekkie of banana sarnies & Tim Tams on the beach before heading off on our 4-hour hike back to Marahau.

We managed it in 3.5hours and stopped off at a couple of beaches along the way. Plus a viewing point which had 270 degree views although the gale-force winds were a bit scary. 

All those gloves, hats and extra jumpers were unnecessary. It was absolutely boiling most of the way.

1165km to 1229km

After lunch moved on to Takaka further north. This journey was a lot more long-winded than our previous one. Beautiful countryside past orchards, vineyards and breathtaking views but tiring taking corner after corner after corner up up up and down down down the other side.

It was almost dark when we arrived and we didn’t fancy another 32km to the DOC campsite so settled down in a gorgeous location. A carpark opposite a supermarket. We’re really living it up.
