We moved to Waldorf Tetra apartments. It was sad to leave Hotel deBrett. And having 4 hours to kill between check-out and check-in consisted of sitting by the harbour and window-shopping. We’d quite like to get to Australia now please.

Proof we saw a bit of Auckland.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P1070583.jpg)

The Tetra apartment is in a not so wonderful location but it’s still pretty close to the centre and we have been upgraded to a two-bedroom apartment. It’s enormous. It’s got an open plan kitchen/diner/lounge area and a very vertigo-challenging balcony. We could live here.

I think we may be mad. It is 8pm and we have just called Qantas to change our flights to Brisbane instead of Sydney. If we wait until Tuesday there will be a fee to change them whereas if we go tomorrow there will be no charge. The catch? The flight is at 6am. What the hell it’s free!

This means getting up at 2:30am to catch a bus. Goodnight.
