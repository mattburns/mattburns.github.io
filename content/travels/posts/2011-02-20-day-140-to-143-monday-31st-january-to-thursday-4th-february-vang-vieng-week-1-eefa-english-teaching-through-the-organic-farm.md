Before heading to Laos I contacted the EEFA Project. EEFA stands for Equal Education For All and is based at the [Organic Farm][1] 4km from Vang Vieng in Phoudindeng. I signed up for 2 weeks of volunteering as an English teacher. A chance to use the TEFL skills and to give something back.

Monday morning I was scared to death. I had no real experience of teaching or of working with kids whatsover. They were going to eat me alive. 

Grabbed a pricey tuk-tuk (40,000kip) in Vang Vieng to go the 4km to the Organic Farm in ****Phou Dindeng for the 9am meeting. Met Amandine another volunteer whom had been at the farm for 2 days last November and was starting 3 weeks of volunteering. There’s some re-organisation going on at the moment so Davone the co-ordinator gave a brief overview of what lessons we would be teaching and Mark the long-term volunteer gave a little bit more info. We had to teach from 10:30 til 11:25 Monday to Wednesday and from 17:00 to 19:00 Monday to Thursday. With that, we had 20 mins to prepare a lesson on transportation and off we rode on borrowed bicycles to the local primary school 1km away.

Both Amandine and I had assumed we had one class between us. Turns out we had a class each. Twenty-five 11 & 12 year olds all ready to learn more English. Scary stuff.

There was a lot of noise coming from the classroom but as soon as I walked in they all ran to their seats and altogether said “Sabaidee”. 

The classroom was quite basic with wooden desks and low thin benches and two blackboards, one usable, one not in such good condition. No glass windows. Just blue shutters which when open wide lit up the room with the strong sunshine. And the room itself was decorated with work by the students from floor to ceiling that gave the room life.

Actually the kids gave it more life than was possibly necessary. 

The lesson went better than I expected. They were learning the present continuous linked with transportation. I am driving a car. She is driving the bus. He is pedalling (?) a bicycle. I am paddling a boat. He is flying a plane. Etc, etc… Lots of flashcards and charades. Me “flying” with arms outstretched around the room making neeeooowww noises. Or brmmmm brmmm with a pretend steering wheel. It’s quite difficult to mime pedalling a bike though. 

The thing with young kids learning English is they tend to imitate exactly what you say so I had hide my giggles when the whole class said “I am driving my caaaaarrrr” in a blatantly forester accent!&nbsp; 

It worked well until just after 11 and they started getting restless, so we split into 2 teams and played hangman. Most of them got the “hang” of it in that they knew they should use words learned in the lesson. One boy though had a 4-letter word which the rest guessed began with B. Yes! Then O? Yes! Ah it’s boat they shout, A and T! Yes I agree as the boy smiles and writes O and K. Book he says and sits down. Umm yes that’s right. 

At 11:25 the bell for end of school rang out and the kids poured out. A few stayed and closed all the shutters and gave me back the flashcards. 

I breathed a sigh of relief. The first lesson was done with and actually it wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. The kids were great. They just need more variety and more games to keep them occupied.

Mr T. let me borrow a bike to cycle back to Vang Vieng after the lesson. They’re not mountain bikes and 4km in the midday heat and back again. You can imagine I definitely lost weight today.

Monday evening was completely different. It was a different school a bit further away and Amandine and I had to teach together. This week is exams for everyone else so only the Level 3s are around (ages 15/16/17+). And today only two students turned up. So we taught prepositions to Khamdee and Khamkeo for the first hour and for the second hour chatted about their lives and ours. Their English is really good. They just need to improve grammar and different tenses. It worked well too as we both helped each other out. It was good to have support.

Had a dodgy cycle back to the farm in the dark. We had no lights and Amandine hit a curb and her chain fell off the bike. Luckily Khamdee & Khamkeo were experts and abandoned their own bikes in the middle of a pitch black road to come back and help. (None of the kids have lights). I thought to myself how I would have no idea how to fix a chain. (How ironic this becomes…)

I then had to get a tuk-tuk back to Vang Vieng. Another 40,000kip. Can’t afford that everyday and not sure I can cycle 8km during the day so will have to get a moped.

&nbsp;

Tuesday was a repeat of yesterday but with different kids in the morning. Slightly younger at 8 and 9 I think. So they got bored of transportation a lot sooner. Though we played more games this time and at the end I got high-5s from the boys and hugs from the girls. I even got a fruit from one girl. They were so sweet!

Regarding my own transportation I tried to get a moped before the morning class but failed miserably as most places only had semi-automatics and I had never driven a moped in my life before. So panicking because I was going to be late I hired an even dodgier bicycle and cycled as fast as I could to the farm only to hit some bumps 1km in and the chain shot off and got jammed in the frame. Shit. Here, on the side of a dusty road, outside Vang Vieng bus station, at the age of 32, is where I learned to fix a chain on a bicycle. And get covered in oil in the process :)

The bloody bike lost it’s chain again on the way between the farm and the school so I begrudgingly cycled the piece of junk straight back to the shop after the lesson and exchanged it for a semi-automatic moped. I had to learn that afternoon how to ride one on an abandoned CIA airstrip. Tuesday was turning out to be a day of lessons for me that I should have learned years ago.

Wednesday I taught at the same school as the evening class and Amandine went to the first school where we both had younger kids again. This time I had to teach the letter L.&nbsp; My favourite letter. Those who know me pretty well will know I have a strange accent for words with “L” in. So trying to teach Lao kids L was entertaining as I heard them repeat after me in a Karen-forester way “aaaalllll”. Luckily all the words began with L rather than ended in L so we had fun learning about Lions, Legs and Lemons and playing silly games.

Managed to get a good deal on a moped for a few days so I’m no longer getting any exercise again.

Thursday there was no morning class only Level 3s in the evening and they had an exam based on the whole term of learning. Amandine and Mark had put it together earlier in the day from the grammar book and I had to read through and check everything made sense. Amandine and I then invigilated the exam in the evening and marked them ready for Monday’s class. Another new experience for me being the teacher wandering around the room whilst the students take the exam.

No teaching tomorrow.

You might wonder what Matt’s up to whilst I’m teaching. Well he was trying to write [stolencamerafinder][6] (check it out again!) but many obstacles came his way.

Monday we had decided to move accommodation as although Paradise was cheap and we had the basics such as bed and hot water and hammock, there was no desk or wifi, both essentials for Matt’s work. So he traipsed around Vang Vieng for the morning and moved all our stuff (in one go – would have loved to have a photo of that!) across the toll bridge to Vilay Vong. A luxurious room in comparison with gorgeous furniture, wifi and on the right side of the river but still far away from the mental bars.

Tuesday Vang Vieng had a power cut from 8.30 til 17:30. Our laptop battery only lasts 2 hours which meant lots of free thinking time for Matt.

Wednesday another powercut. They’re digging up the roads or something. Plus we had to move from Vilay Vong G.H. to Phoom Chai G.H. up the road as they’d double-booked our room. Guest House No. 3. So Matt had to move our stuff once again whilst I was at school and then later came with me to the farm in the afternoon and utilised their power supply for 4hours whilst I prepared the lesson and went to class. Had dinner at the farm too which was delicious when it finally came. 

Thursday no powercut so lots of stolencamerafinder done.
