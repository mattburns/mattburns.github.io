Kolkata (previously known as Calcutta although may still be known as Calcutta as many people still say they’re from Bombay even though its now Mumbai – must check this out) was a pleasant surprise for a large city. 

We arrived late Tuesday night as our train took 2hrs longer than it needed to. Somehow Uli, the German trainee architect who is studying in Vienna, had wangled us a lift to our hotel with a lovely Kolkatan couple whose driver met them at the station in their new Jeep wagon thing that had room for a family of 10 and still had the bubble wrap on the spare wheel. They were happy to go out of their way to take us to central Kolkata before they went to their home in South Kolkata as it was gone 1am and they knew the taxis would rip us off. Uli has also managed to wangle himself a free chicken sandwich which the driver picked up from Subway on his way to the station.

Hotel Pushpak was a dated business hotel with a grand front entrance with marble floors and comfy sofas. I could hardly say “mineral water” I was so tired – it took 5 attempts for the guy to understand me – must be my accent. But he expected us to fill in forms about our names and addresses and other complicated information like that. Unfortunately there were no other spare rooms so Uli was led out into the night to another more expensive hotel nearby. We never saw him again so I hope it worked out OK wherever you ended up Uli. We feel bad for getting your lift to our hotel and you had to go find somewhere else to stay. Sorry Uli!!

We had the creepiest guy take us to our room. He looked like an Indian Lurch. Too tall and gangly so he kind of swayed over like a palm tree. He walked ahead into our room, turned the TV on and then went to leave, changed his mind, over to the A/C machine, turned that on, back to the doorway, switched on the bathroom lights, loitered a bit more. I was thinking he’s after a tip here. It’s friggin’ 1:30am and we’re like zombies and Frankenstein wants us to think about tipping him for showing us how the TV works. He grew impatient and grinning said “you can tip if you like?”, cheeky git. Matt gave him a tenner (14p) and he grinned even more. As he backed out of the room slowly he kept saying “room service 502, OK? anything you want 502 OK?” about 5 times. It felt like a lifetime had passed when he finally left and we could bolt the door before he wandered back in.

_The fan in our room had somehow managed to work its way across the ceiling:_

Does anyone know why even if you’re really knackered and need to sleep you still become hypnotised by TV? We’d become hooked on VH1. “Oh is this more like MTV now playing new music? Didn’t they used to play old people music when we were younger?”, Matt says. Then realises the Foo Fighters and Green Day songs they’re playing are from the nineties and are for old people.

Sorry just realised I said about 3hrs ago how good Kolkata is and haven’t even got through the night yet. 

In brief, Kolkata was less hectic, less annoying as there were fewer tuk-tuks and so many yellow taxis on decent roads with traffic lights you could have thought you were in New York. There is a large green(ish) space which reminded me of the downs and it was easy to find our way to the main Park St area with shopping centres and restaurants. Perhaps Delhi could have been a more similar experience if we’d let it but we found it difficult to navigate and the heat was unbearable. 

As we only had one proper day in Kolkata we got our backsides in gear and did 4 touristy things:

1. Victoria Memorial

This place is MASSIVE. It’s a huge white building which was started in 1901 for Queen Victoria (Empress of India) when she was alive and finished 20years later, 20 years after she died. It has large marble domes with stained glass and is set in enormous grounds with a statue of the lady herself sat on a throne in the front. You could easily pick it up and put it in Surrey and it wouldn’t look out of place. It did in India. British monarchs were so pompous.

We were just heading towards the gates when an Indian family asked if they could take a photo. No problem we said. Suddenly a small child was thrust into Matt’s arms and we were suddenly part of a family portrait. How trusting they were to give a random bloke their child. Especially one with little experience of holding kids!

2. Indian Museum

Another colonial type building with a cool courtyard and lots of Buddhist and Hindu statues which were cool. The very last thing we saw as it was closing were pickled embryos of different mammals. This included 2 human embryos, one full term. Weird.

3. Planetarium

Even weirder was this place. We arrived early to avoid the queues and was glad we did as the line of people went out the gate. Except that the line only had about 40 people in it and the planetarium, being one of the largest in the world, swallowed us all up easily so that you hardly noticed anyone else there. Except for the crying baby. But we only noticed that so well because the “narrator” lady would stop speaking mid-sentence every time the baby cried. And the parents would muffle it until it stopped crying perhaps due to lack of oxygen whilst being smothered.

The planetarium was an impressive building. Shame about the presentation. It was like a cross between a bad 70’s sci-fi show and being in an extremely boring science class with the teacher not being able to use the OHP properly and she’s forgotten her glasses so everything starts off in focus but immediately switch out of focus. And/or leave another sheet on top of the OHP blocking out half of Jupiter. She could see well enough to tell off the guy with his mobile phone switched on though.

4. McDonalds

Our first of the trip. Of course no beef in India so the menu consisted of chicken burgers, chicken nuggets and veggie burgers. There had to be an equivalent Big Mac of course – the Chicken Maharaja Mac. Hmmmm I’ve tasted more chicken in a big mac at home but it had to be done.

And that was about that for Kolkata. We left early Thursday morning to get to the airport in plenty of time. Not before the Pushpak guy asked for more tips sir. What the hell for? You were asleep on a mattress when we came downstairs. Yeah ok you got us a taxi but there were quite a few outside the front door so guessing we could have managed that by ourselves. What a load of @!*$!

We did honestly like Kolkata though really.
