THE SUN IS SHINING! 

We have found the sun at last. Proper hot sun. The real skin-crisping kind. MIA since Sihanoukville. Although I guess you could say Siem Reap was hot & sunny but there could be no sunbathing there unless you wanted to look like a KFC family bucket.

Hearing rumours of kangaroos grazing at the north tip of Hervey Bay we borrowed bikes and followed the bike track along the esplanade for 6 or 7km until we reached a sandy bay we couldn’t resist. The sun was blazing by now, the beach was almost deserted and the sea lapped at the shore looking like a giant infinity pool. 

90 mins later we thought we’d better go off and find these kangaroos but instead were distracted by the baby pink ice-cream campervan that just that minute pulled up in the car park with his cheesy tune playing. A Mr Whippys dipped in nuts served by a guy with a mullet wearing a bow-tie couldn’t be avoided.

We cycled to the end of the esplanade and further until we eventually reached the kangaroo warning signs.

But alas it was not meant to be. We popped out of the other end of the roo grazing area with no kangas in sight. Turning around we ventured back along the same road and still no sign. 

Nothing was to be done except cycle the 7km back to our hostel unfulfilled.

And we were disappointed not to see any of these guys on our cycle back either.
