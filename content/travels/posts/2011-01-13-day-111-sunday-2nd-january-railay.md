Just about recovered from New Year shenanigans now and we ventured to the 4th and final beach in the Railay area. It is reachable by longtail from West beach, by walking from West beach (we believe) or by walking from Railay East. The pathway from East is right outside Railay Cabana so it was an easy choice to make. Not so easy walk though although it was lovely to walk through the jungle and see more amazing butterflies, we saw the “Tsunami village” where there were a few shells of buildings. We couldn’t quite believe the wave had reached so far inland. The toughest part was a steep climb upwards as the beach is the other side of the rocks behind our bamboo hut. It was so steep there were climbing ropes tied along it to help keep your balance. I ended up on my ass typically on the way down the other side.

The sign says 800m to Ton Sai beach from Railay Cabana. That is a big fib. It is twice as far as once you get to the first set of shops and restaurants is another 10min walk to the beach. It’s also not as nice a beach for sunbathing or paddling as West or Phranang as it’s more stony than sandy but still has incredible views and lovely beach eateries. It’s more for climbers as there were many on the cliffs at either end of the beach.

We caught the longtail back to West beach and hired a kayak to paddle to Phranang beach and out to the rocks we could see from the beach. It became quite a hairy experience at one point as we paddled around one of the large karsts. The wind had picked up and we were not really in control of where we were headed for a few minutes. One minute we were angled out to sea, the next towards the rocks. But we made it and it all adds to the fun.

More sunbathing on Phranang beach and the beginning of the sunset before kayaking back to West beach before it was too dark.
