Matt got up at dawn to go find the perfect view of the Petronas towers and came back 3 hours later with his sunrise timelapse from the KLCC park and was knackered so snoozed whilst I trawled the internet for ideas on what to do for Christmas. So many places to decide on. Found cheap flights to Bali but does it make sense to go that way or should we head overland through Malaysia and up to Thailand. But then Thailand only does 15day visas if you enter overland so should we fly from KL? And where do we stay? So many places are booked up already. No idea where is best to go. Argghhhhh.

Sod that went for a walk instead to the KL tower with the idea that we’d go up to the top to get a view of the Petronas towers. Got to the entrance, realised you could only see the towers end on so one hid the other, found out it was 38RM to go up the thing and the weather was rainy and foggy so doubted it would be any good anyway and made the best decision not to bother. Instead we went to the Traders Hotel on the south of KLCC park and sat in the Skybar (with pool) on the 33rd floor with perfect views across the park of the Petronas towers and drank happy hour cocktails and beer for only a little bit more money than it would have cost to go up the KL Tower. Matt did a sunset timelapse and we were happy bunnies. I don’t think you could get a better view in KL.

Yes, that is a swimming pool in the foreground! It was tipping it down when we left we headed for the only place we know – Carmen’s Vinothek. More wine please vicar. Plus the best pizza ever – duck and wild mushroom. Life doesn’t get any better than this! OK so all we do is eat and drink and in KL we haven’t tried much authentic Malaysian food but it’s nice to have some things that remind us of home sometimes. That’s OK isn’t it? :)
