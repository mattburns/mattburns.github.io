Tuesday 14th December and we have been travelling for exactly 3 months and we’re now in Malaysia. Can’t believe how fast the time is going.

Took a lovely luxury bus from Singapore to Melaka. The border crossings were simple. Off the bus at one side of the bridge to exit Singapore and get our passport stamped. Then off the bus again the other side of the bridge to get our entry to Malaysia. We thought we’d only get 30 days but the stamp says we can stay for 90 days. Not sure we will but it’s good to know.

We’re staying at a gorgeous guesthouse called Jalan Jalan in Chinatown. This area of Melaka has loads of character. The buildings are very pretty and there are beautiful temples everywhere.

The guesthouse feels like a home as it’s painted in contemporary colours with a central communal area that’s like exactly like a sitting room with a big comfy sofa, stereo, computer, bookcase, and tea & coffee. Plus our room has an **electric** shower with hot water. Luxury. The guy who runs it Sam is really sweet and chilled and at the front there is an artist studio with some very cool artwork. 

We decided to be completely cheesy tourists and go on the 40min boat ride which goes 20mins up the canal and 20mins back. It seems like a lot of the old buildings have been replaced with new ones and they even have a monorail! But the newer buildings have been painted with huge murals which make what would be ugly boring blocks of cement part of the scenery.

Hopped on the Merdeka Taming Sari, a 360 degree revolving platform that moves up a huge pole to give views over the city. Can’t say there was much to see that stood out but it seemed popular and was quite cool going up so high.

Had lunch in Donald & Lily’s, an LP recommendation (that wasn’t closed down) and tried the Laksa which is chilli soup with seafood. Tasty stuff. I love the fact that everywhere has Christmas decorations up regardless of religion:

We got hooked on dim sum & pork balls for breakfast at this place where they bring out a range of dim sum on a huge tray and you pick 4 or 5 dishes there and then. They’re usually filled with pork or shrimp. ![IMG_8454](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_8454.jpg) 

More quirky things to see in Melaka:
