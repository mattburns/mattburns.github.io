I am writing two days together as they have events that bleed from one day to the next.

The drive from Kaka Point to Dunedin was non-descript.

Dunedin on the other hand has been colourful to say the least.

There are no holiday parks in the centre so we decided to go for a cheap backpackers called Pennys 5 mins walk from The Octagon (city centre). They had one double room left. We asked how much and the guy said make me an offer. Strange we thought. But it was a windowless dingy looking room. Matt suggested forty dollars and the guy agreed. No haggling. That seemed a bargain to us as the closest holiday park wanted $46. Too good to be true me thinks.

Two hours later there’s a knock at the door. Another bloke who works there is saying there has been a mistake and we need to move to a dorm. There’s one across the hall that is empty and so he’d try to keep it that way if possible. OK we agree to move. 

20 mins later he’s back. We have to move to another dorm because that one was now fully-booked. Right. He says we can get a discount and a bottle of wine. So now we’re having to take a bed in a filled to the brim dorm. Neither of us was sure about this but were just about to go out before all the moving palava and neither of us wanted the hassle of moving somewhere else. It was only one night after all. Maybe the wine swayed our decision. 

So we head out into Dunedin for a few beers and a bento box. Returning hours later slightly worse for wear. Very good bars in Dunedin by the way. Especially Albar, a Scottish pub with British ales, German weisse bier and Bulmers on tap. 

Crash out in the dorm.

At 5am two guys come back drunk and the one who happens to be sleeping in the bed above us starts shouting about someone having been through his stuff. Babbling on about he’d been round the world and never been anywhere like this. Etc etc. Starts having a go at another couple in the next bed. Turns the light on and carries on. We try to ignore him but he starts to grate and I am particularly grumpy when woken up so start having a go back telling him to grow up (apparently he was 32!) and we pack our things and leave. 

As we leave the guy who’d moved us asks us to stay and back him up for when the police arrive. No thanks he’s your problem not ours mate.

So we end up camping in the van anyway in the middle of Dunedin. Not ideal.

This morning is a write-off as we are both too tired to do anything.

This afternoon is also a write-off, more of the van this time though. Very annoyingly we try to park in an underground carpark not realising the van is higher than the gap. Bugger bugger bugger bugger bugger. So we have a nice dent in the roof of the van that will need paying for. Looks like our trip will have to be cut shorter than we thought. Can’t be helped.

In the commotion we also lose the carpark ticket so get a lecture off the car park attendant about people losing their tickets and they should pay blah blah blah before finally giving us a spare one. (I find it inside the road atlas 5 mins after leaving the carpark).

To top it all off Matt has also found out today that GadgetTrak have decided to also create a “Stolen Camera Finder”. So now there’s some competition. Good news is his site will be mentioned in an article in The Economist. So there’s always a silver lining.

It is now 24 hours since we checked into that darn hostel and this is one day we wouldn’t mind being a groundhog one.

Lets hope the rest of the trip is less eventful. The rest of this day certainly will be as we’re parked up in a nice holiday park on the edge of Dunedin and we’re not leaving the van until the morning.

Oh Matt did get a full refund from the hostel in the end and turns out it was the guy’s mate that had been through his bag looking for something. He’d forgotten. The shouting guy had been kicked out by the police and had slept in his car.
