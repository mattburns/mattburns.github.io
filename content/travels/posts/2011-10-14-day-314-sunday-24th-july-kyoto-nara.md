Not content with staying in one place for very long off we popped to Nara, the old capital of Japan from 710 to 784AD, 45 mins on the train from Kyoto.

They are revamping the train station so it took us 30 mins to find the bicycle hire place which turned out to be right out of the station instead of left.

We intended to hire normal bikes but of course they had electric ones so who could resist? A lot of nodding of heads and pointing followed by not giving any deposit whatsover and agreeing to something written in kanji and we were off for max 2hour hire. Plenty of time to see everything.

Turns out Nara is bigger and more spread out than we expected. They also have a LOT of deer. Nara Park has as many deer grazing as the Forest of Dean has sheep (and wild boar now apparently) roaming the roads.

Spotted a guy selling deer biscuits (food for deer not made from deer) in the park and thought that might be a nice idea to feed some sweet gentle deer. Little did I know that they KNOW when you have deer food and they turn into hungry zombie-eyed vicious creatures with head-butting antlers and sharp teeth. As I tried to pull individual biscuits from the pile and feed them to a few nearby deer more and more descended like crazed demons nudging and nipping and biting my backside. Matt stood there laughing and taking photos as I threw the pile on the floor and ran away from them. He didnâ€™t get a chance to feed any himself.

I now have new found respect for wild animals. Especially wild hungry animals. And it doesnâ€™t matter whether they look as sweet as bambi they are not to be sniffed at.

This one was a cutie though ðŸ˜€

Enough of deer, we had temples to visit. Toda-ji was first on the list. The worldâ€™s largest wooden structure.

Containing the worldâ€™s largest bronze Buddha. On a par with the worldâ€™s largest spatula Iâ€™d say.

Theyâ€™re trying to raise money to re-tile the roof so we paid a few Yen to have a tile added with our own personal message.

They may need to patch up some holes in the supporting pillars tooâ€¦

Temple-viewing is hungry work so we stopped for green tea ice-cream near the coy carp pond where hungry deer were loitering. This time they didnâ€™t spot us with food and it was nice being able to laugh at other people being chased for a change.

We rode the bikes around the park to several other temples most of which were up and down hills so we were glad of the electric power.

We had to whizz round the last few temples, through some pretty woodland with concrete pillars which centuries ago would have been built to hold candles and light the way. They looked like they are still used today.

Had a time for a super-quick late lunch stop at McDonalds of all places, in the old capital of Japan. Had to be the Teriyaki burger for me. And in optimal time delivered the leccy bikes back with seconds to spare and hopped onto the next train back to Kyoto.

Back at the hostel it was time for sake & dressing up.

For some reason we headed out to Gion again for dinner, forgetting it was really expensive, and somehow thought we could walk it in 20mins but completely misjudged how far it was. Took 50 mins to find anywhere we remotely recognised and so I was a little grumpy from the hunger by then.

We struggled to find anywhere cheap enough or open enough until we ended up on the same street as last nightâ€™s sushi bar. It was a welcoming little noodle bar and we asked for the menu. The guy smiled at us and directed us towards what looked like a ticket machine with lots of buttons and Japanese writing. You had to put money in, select what you wanted and get token out. This was exciting, it was pot luck!

What came was a bowl of steaming hot noodles with pork cooked to order in a flash. Japanese fast food. Delicious.

A Geisha in Gion.
