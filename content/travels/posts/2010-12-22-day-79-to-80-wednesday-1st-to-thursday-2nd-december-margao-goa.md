We have spent most of December so far in hospital. Matt completely lost his appetite and by the time we arrived in Goa he was feeling sick and everything else all over again. We checked into Margao Residency (with hot water!) and both slept for a few hours (neither of us had much sleep on the train). By 5pm he was in such a state I made him see a doctor. Fortunately Margao is a large town so there were a number of doctors within spitting distance of our hotel. We traipsed around for 20mins not actually finding one in their office until down a side alley we found one with a receptionist who called the doctor to speak to Matt about his symptoms and said he’d be back in 10-20mins (India time). 40mins later he turned up and 10mins after that we were traipsing off to the hospital as Matt has an infection that can’t be treated by tablets. Instead he needs intravenous drugs. 

The receptionist brought us to the “hospital”, Dr Divakar Lolavekar’s Hospital to be precise, which seems to take up half a floor in an office block above a bank and below “Atul’s clinical lab”. We were greeted by a group of young giggly nurses. Did we want a private room? A/C or non-A/C?&nbsp; We are in a large room with 2 hospital beds, a TV, 2 fans. A/C and attached bathroom. All for 750 per night. Cheaper than Margao Residency. They took his details and I had to sign the form – it was my responsibility to admit him!

The nurses plugged Matt in last night and now 29hrs later he’s still plugged in. Matt asked one nurse are the needles disposable and she replied innocently she didn’t know as she only started that day! Luckily the head nurse confirmed that everything is one use only so put our minds at ease. They’ve got him on metrogyl and saline. Plus injections and some tablet a couple of times a day. We don’t really know what they’re giving him altogether but he’s improving.

Yesterday the doctor said 1-2 days in hospital. Today a nurse said 2-3 days. Both hoping we can check out tomorrow.

I had to check us out of Margao Residency this morning so beforehand did some trips with all our bags from over to the hospital & washed my hair in hot water for the first time in at least 3 weeks. Then went on the hunt for some food for Matt. He’s allowed to have veggie stuff only and juice. Soup seemed like the perfect solution. Nowhere sells soup. Especially non-spicy stuff to takeaway. I asked all over and the best I came across was packet tomato soup. But you need hot water for that.

Managed to find a place that did fresh juice at last and the lovely Anita, who owns “Oasis food bar”, when she found out Matt was in the hospital and needed food offered to boil some veg. So off I go to the market to buy proper fresh vegetables. Haven’t done that in a long time! Took them back to Anita and an hour later she’d boiled the whole lot up in a big pot of salted water. She piled half into a large jug and put the rest aside “for later”. It was a feast! To have freshly cooked vegetables without sauces and spices was delicious. Matt hadn’t realised how hungry he was and I have never seen him eat a plate of vegetables so willingly before!

I’d said to Matt we must pop by and see her when he is better and then who should pop by to visit? Anita and her daughter Brenda (recently married). How sweet is that?!

So back I go for a jug refill at dinnertime and Matt is now full of nutritious grub for the first time in 3 months! 

For all the gripes we have of this country there have now been many instances when we have met people with so much kindness who have helped us and made us feel welcome. I can’t believe how amazing Anita has been. She didn’t know me this morning and she has made us food and we have some of her things and I haven’t paid her anything yet. People are very trusting here. It’s a good quality to have. 

Just as an aside, Anita had been to stay with her sister in Kent for 6 months over the summer and they’d taken her to Margate. She said the water was absolutely freezing and prefers Goa’s beaches. :)
