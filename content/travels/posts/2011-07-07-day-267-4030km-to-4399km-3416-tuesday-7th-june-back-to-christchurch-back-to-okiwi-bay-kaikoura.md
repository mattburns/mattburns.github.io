Todayâ€™s weather: improved, some blue sky. No rain.

Drove around the Banks Peninsula bays of Baron Bay and Okains Bay. Two secluded beaches with not a soul but us. Sometimes this travelling at off-peak really has its benefits. This took us along the tourist drive on the summit of the peninsula so you could really see how this area used to be volcanoes. Again stunning scenery.

Stopped for a spot of lunch in a teeny bay I canâ€™t remember the name of.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_7483.jpg)

And drove through a familiar sounding village on the Banks Peninsula I donâ€™t need to remember the name of.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_7488.jpg)

Pest control. Possums arenâ€™t native to NZ and they are destroying the natural flora and fauna so they take extreme measures.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P1070212.jpg)

Crunch time. Took the van back to Wilderness for a quote. 

On first glance the guy at Wilderness said it looked better than he thought. But I wondered if he was just being nice. Half hour of waiting and he was back with a quote. Deep breathsâ€¦Â£660. Yes! Only a little bit more than the excess waiver insurance. Phew! I think Matt may have been more relieved than me ðŸ˜‰. Though I think my hair is happier as in the last few days itâ€™s turned greyer than itâ€™s ever been. (Matt steered me towards the hairdye today.

Itâ€™ll be fixed in Auckland so off we trot again up north as the light dims and the rains lash down and kip at our trusted DOC campsite Okiwi Bay near Kaikoura.
