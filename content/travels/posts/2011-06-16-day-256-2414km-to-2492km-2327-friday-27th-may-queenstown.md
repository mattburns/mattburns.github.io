Random photos taken before leaving Wanaka.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_6132.jpg)

This one was taken by Matt after he turned the van around on a busy main road to specifically to this field of sheep, parked up, ran across the road, tried jumping over a ditch and promptly sprained his ankle. Any excuse not to drive. ![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_6140.jpg)

Stunning views on the road from Wanaka to Queenstown. Queenstown is in a beautiful setting on Lake Wakatipu surrounded by snow-capped mountains. We love it. Even more than Wanaka.

The town itself has a good vibe. Lots of cafes, bars, restaurants, shops and tonnes of extreme sports agents. 

We decided to join the infamous Kiwi bar crawl to mingle with some other people. Being in a campervan is fun but sometimes we need some time away from just us two in a 6ft x 20ft box on wheels..

Neither of us have been that drunk in a while (well I guess it was Bangkok with Wend & Steve).

One of the highlights and another reason for joining the crawl was access to Minus 5 bar – a bar made completely of ice. They provide a padded duffel coat, gloves and booties for us girlies with teeny shoes. Everything was made of ice, even the glasses of vodka cocktail. And the benches. Very cool (excuse the pun).

I couldn’t resist trying to eat the cocktail glass (well it seemed like a good idea at the time).![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/06/P1060896.jpg)

Rest of the evening consisted of more bars, free pizza and dancing back at World’s Bar at the end.

Followed by a long freezing walk back to our bargain campsite 2km from town. Why oh why didn’t we pay the extra and stay in town!?!
