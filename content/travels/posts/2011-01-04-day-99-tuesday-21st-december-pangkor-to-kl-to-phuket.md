Another mental journey planned by us. Instead of going overland up to Krabi we decided to fly to Phuket from Kuala Lumpur. So we could get the 30-day visa instead of the 15-day visa. (For some reason there is a difference in Thailand depending on whether you enter overland or via an airport???)

Our journey:

7.45am Pink minibus taxi from Telak Nipah to Pangkor Town

8.30am Ferry from Pangkor Town to Lumut

9.10am in KFC of all places to have brekkie. 10min wait turns into a 25min wait for the weirdest breakfast wrap we’ve ever tasted. Chicken sausage, scrambled egg, mashed hash browns & liquid cheese wrapped in a pancake. Mmmmm (ughhhh).

10am 5hr coach journey from Lumut to KL via Ipoh and everyone else and their dog who wanted to get on. Halfway through the journey Matt’s glasses broke so added that to the itinerary.

3pm Dropped off in a random place in the middle of KL. Finally worked out we were in Chinatown and got two tubes to Times Square mall where we knew there was an AirAsia in case we had to book onward flights. Plus it had opticians.

Spent over an hour looking in 3 different optical shops at glasses and Matt came to a decision at 4.30pm (we had to go to the airport at 5pm). Then they gave him an eye test. Clock was ticking. 4.45 finally they were ready to make new glasses. We legged it to AirAsia to ask about onward tickets and the guy was clueless. Started blathering on about getting to the airport 3hrs before and checking there. How long does it take to get to the airport? 1hour. Right and we have 3hrs to our flight. That would work. So we gambled without an onward ticket.

5.05 back in the shop. glasses are miraculously ready (how do they do that?)

5.20 Taxi to LCCT (suddenly realised we were flying from Low Cost Carrier Terminal which is 20mins from main international terminal so no time to get buses/tubes plus a taxi worked out cheaper)

6.20 Checked in at AirAsia with no mention of onward journey ticket, Phew we have time for McDonalds! (Really pigging out today)

8.00 I sneakily pop off to Duty Free to buy a Toblerone for Matt for xmas. It comes to just below the card limit so unfortunately have to buy Milka bar too. Poor me. Pick up some freebie candy canes too for more xmassy touches.

9.00 on the plane eating our free meal that no-one else seems to have. It’s only 1hr 15min flight so no wonder. Plus we thought we were getting pasta or a sarnie and we end up&nbsp; with Chicken Biryani! We weren’t even hungry but who says no to free food (a blip on AirAsia website that only we seemed to spot :)

9:40 (Thailand time – clocks go back 1hour) Arrive Phuket ariport. Spend half hour in immigration queue and another half hour trying to get money out of a cashpoint before finding the poor taxi guy who’s been waiting since 8:40.

11:15 In Pineapple Guest House, Hat Karon, Phuket, THAILAND!! With the biggest fridge we’ve ever seen in a hotel room!

Would it really have taken us longer to get here over land? ;)

Night.
