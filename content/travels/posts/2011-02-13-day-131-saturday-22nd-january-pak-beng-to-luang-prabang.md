Another earlyish start. After yesterday’s overflowing boat we wanted to make sure we got a seat. We boarded the boat at 8:10 for a 9:00 departure to find it was a different boat from yesterday. This time there were about 20 car seats and the rest were stiff wooden benches about 8cm deep. 

At least we had a seat though. And there were cushions too covered in teddy bear material and many people didn’t get a seat so can’t complain (much). It was only for 9hours after all.

The loo had a unique shaped window with a lovely view of the Mekong:

Cruising down the river the boat often stopped at villages to collect or drop off supplies. This lady is carrying rice to send on the boat for sale.![P1040656](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/02/P1040656.jpg) 

As well as supplies, a large Lao family boarded halfway through the journey. As they passed through the boat they bowed as low they could before sitting on the floor between the chairs. One guy offered his seat to the eldest lady and she looked grateful but nervous. Another lady perched on the end of a couple’s seat and the girl proceeded to be rude about her as though she couldn’t understand. She may not have been able to understand English but you don’t need to be able to speak the same language to understand tone of voice and body language. I could have slapped her. Just very immature as a lot of the passengers were that day.

We arrived in Luang Prabang at 5.30, an hour earlier than we expected and just as the sun was setting across the Mekong and over the mountains. Again absolutely stunning.

Seemed to find a nice guest house and first impressions… we like it a lot.
