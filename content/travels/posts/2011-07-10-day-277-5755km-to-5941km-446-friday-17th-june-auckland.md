Had a nose around Coromandel town and not much was going on. A few little cafes & souvenir shops plus a bakery that served up good seafood pie.

Drove down the west coast of the peninsula with lovely views all the way, then stopped at the most random place for lunch next to a bird reserve with no views of the sea. 

Managed to make it to Auckland mid-afternoon and can’t get over the size of the place. We actually liked being stuck in Friday afternoon traffic on a 3-lane motorway. It was refreshing to see signs of civilisation. To see more than two people at a time.

Visited Isla & Neil, whom we had met four times in India & shared the [Old Cask Rum with in Fort Kochin][1]. It was good to see them and share travelling stories. We had home-cooked food & lots of red wine and it was nice to sleep in a normal bed after so many weeks in the campervan.
