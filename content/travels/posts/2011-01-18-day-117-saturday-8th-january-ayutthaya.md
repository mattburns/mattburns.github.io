From now on Matt doesn’t know where we’re going or staying. It’s kind of a birthday pressie for him. No stress of having to worry about route or accommodation. So I’ve booked the next few days already.

Our first train experience in Thailand from Bangkok to Ayutthaya was pleasant.&nbsp; Although not sleeper trains it reminded us of India with the shutters and open windows and people walking by with baskets of sandwiches, drinks and dried fish. This is a common sight in Thailand. Dried fish are sold on streetstalls and in markets and have a strange petshop aroma. We’ve yet to&nbsp; try one.

We are only here 1 day so after checking in at the youth hostel we hired bikes to explore the city. It’s not a very bike-friendly place but it’s a good way of getting around as the temples are spread out. 

We saw the main tourist sight Wat Phra Mahathat with the Buddha head caught between the roots of a tree. It was much smaller than we envisaged as the photos we had seen contain only roots and the head so it is difficult to tell the perspective without seeing it for real.

Ayuthaya is an island surrounded by 3 rivers and we fancied a boat trip around the city to see some of the other temples. Do you think we could find out anything about them? I called the hostel and the guy’s English wasn’t so good so he ended up just telling me that they close the gate at 11pm. We cycled round the riversides but couldn’t see anything advertised. So gave up and went to see the reclining Buddha. This one is outside unlike in Bangkok and was being renovated so it was surrounded by what looked like oil drums and had a large ladder leaning against it. Not so photogenic as Matt would have liked.

For dinner I pretended I didn’t know where we were going and took Matt down this random road that looked like nowhere. I was beginning to think it really was leading nowhere then luckily spotted a small sign for the place Baan Khun Phra which was a riverside restaurant opposite a temple with a shimmering golden reflection. Lush.
