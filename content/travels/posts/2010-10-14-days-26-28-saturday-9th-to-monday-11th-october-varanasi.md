Varanasi has been our most surreal experience yet in India. More tuk-tuk touts than you can shake a stick at but a very spiritual and dream-like place. 

Paul van der Werf from the train joined us and we made our way to Chaitanya Guest House in Assi Ghat which is the most southerly ghat in Varanasi and was very pleasant. There wasn’t the same amount of hustle and bustle here as in the old city which Varanasi is famous for.

Chaitanya Guest House was run by a friendly quiet man who we hardly saw. The room was very pretty with 3 stained glass windows and a view of the Ganges. Every morning we were woken by the sun streaming through the window arches and the sound of the pipe seller walking up and down the path playing his tunes with at least 50 pipes splayed on his shoulder.

At dusk the three of us hired a rowing boat with 3 men aboard to take us up the Ganges to see the sights. There was some discussion around the price as the river was high they wanted 1000 rupees. We didn’t really understand why the height of the river made any difference to the cost and so after some bartering and to-ing and fro-ing they agreed on 400 rupees.

Sunny, the youngest (maybe 18 or 19)&nbsp; rowed us most of the way there passing all of the other ghats which were a mixture of old and new, some amazing and some ugly concrete structures. Babu, the second oldest, gave us some info on Varanasi and the oldest guy steered the boat with a third oar.&nbsp; After about half an hour we reached the burning ghat “Manikarnika Ghat” where they carry out cremations 24/7. Paul went ashore to see the cremations up close but us two stayed on the boat. I think Matt would have liked to have gone but stayed with me. Whilst Paul was gone Babu asked me how old I was. When I said 32 he was shocked. He said he thought I was older! Not because of my face, he said I had a young face but my hair was old. Ah the grey again. It’s getting really bad. In India they don’t normally go grey until 50 or 60 so he was surprised at my age. Really need to get some hair dye :)

Not detracting too much from the burning ghat by discussing hair colour, the fact Babu doesn’t have a doctor because he keeps his health by drinking from and bathing in the Ganges (which in places is septic) and then showing me his “bhang” wrapped in a leaf which you can chew with sugar, the atmosphere here was ghostly and I felt like I shouldn’t be there. There were fires lit on the bank of the ghat and a number of boats with tourists gathered around.&nbsp; Paul said he’d seen some of the bodies being laid on the fires but it didn’t seem like it was real because they were wrapped up. Still it seemed liked we shouldn’t have been there at all. Apparently certain bodies aren’t burned but thrown wrapped into the Ganges. These include pregnant women and babies. I was sure I saw someone throw a small bundle into the river whilst we were waiting for Paul. That spooked me and I kept looking for bundles all the way back. At one point we all spotted a large form floating in the river and was relieved (although still something I’d not want to see again) to realise it was a dead cow.

We next stopped at the main ghat Dasaswamedh Ghat where the daily ritual “ganga aarti” was being performed. Guys dreessed in bright orange and gold were either clinking symbols or moving various flame filled items around their heads whilst another guy struck a gong over and over. Our boat pulled up behind a larger flat-roofed vessel and we were able to climb up onto the roof to get a better look. Whilst the older guy bailed out some of the water from our boat.

Again it was dream-like. I can’t describe exactly what it felt like to be there. But it was fascinating to watch and realise that they do this every day for an hour and it is a normal part of life here. In the UK if anyone did the same they’d be laughed at. 

It was pretty dark when we left the ritual and both Sunny and Babu had to row as the current was so strong going back down the river.&nbsp; It took an hour to get back to Assi Ghat and at points we were rowed to the edge of a ghat and pushed by guys on the bank to get us around the strong current. We felt helpless watching the two guys struggle with the boat. Now we understood why they wanted more money. We felt we should give them more than we agreed.

Before setting off we had bought lotus flowers from a small girl who had persisted with me for 10mins whilst we negotiated prices. They are small bowls made of pressed dried leaves with flower petals and a candle. Good for the karma. So we lit these on the way back and watched them float for a couple of seconds before being taken into the Ganges by the current.

Honestly that experience just feels like a dream now. It was very unreal and we can’t quite believe it happened. That we were sat on a rowing boat in the dark on the Ganges watching cremations and Hindu rituals.

&nbsp;

Reality hit when we tried to go out to eat. Being in Assi Ghat meant that there was not a large choice of restaurants nearby. So we decided to head for the Shanti Guest House rooftop restaurant near the burning ghat. It took us 20 mins to get a tuk-tuk (how come there’s always thousands when you don’t want one and none when you do?!) and then we had a 15min walk down the windiest streets I’ve seen to find this place in the back and beyond. On the way out when we asked directions to the main road, rather than trying to explain the guy walked us there as it was such a maze. Though the alleyways were narrow they were filled with men marching towards the burning ghat,&nbsp; carrying a stretcher with a wrapped up body. Another heading for cremation and eternal life in the Ganges. 

&nbsp;

Paul left for Kathmandu on Sunday and we being our usually lazy selves didn’t venture that far. Found the best pizza place so far though right next to Assi Ghat so we watched the smaller ganga aarti ceremony there whilst eating spinach pizza and apple pie and ice-cream. We did think about going to the fort but it was so hot in Varanasi you couldn’t stay in the heat very long.

As Monday was checking out day and we were leaving Varanasi we settled down at Open Hand Cafe for 6 hours. Yes six. It was a really inspiring little place. Both a cafe and craft shop inter-mingled you sat drinking coffee amongst scarves, handbags, artwork and furnishings. Everything was of a high quality and had been hand-made by physically challenged women and it was all fixed price so no bartering needed. A fairtrade cafe come gift shop with a chilled out atmosphere, good food, good music – just the kind of place I could see myself running :)

&nbsp;

After sitting on our backsides all day we headed to Mughal Sarai train station 20km away. Half the road there was missing as usual so it was an obstacle course but then we somehow managed to join a huge highway. There we were in this little tuk-tuk speeding past trucks beeping his horn as we went as though that would have made much difference to those monsters! I think we hit 35mph. The fastest we’ve been in a tuk-tuk. Matt had made a deal with the driver – we had to be there by 6pm or we wouldn’t pay. 5.55 we arrived so we paid the man.

Our train was delayed by almost 2 hours in the end and when we found our seats everyone was ready for bed, as were the guys who had our seats. They moved out of the way but refused to leave the carriage and were adamant they were sleeping on the floor. They had been on the “waitlist” which means you buy a ticket with the potential that a seat may come free if someone else cancelled. Normally you don’t board the train if your name isn’t on the list at the station but these guys did. Matt politely asked them to move but it must be normal for people to board without a valid ticket and sleep wherever they fancy because we gave in in the end and I think at least one of them slept in between the two lower bunks!

We also met another English couple today in our train compartment who happened to be from Thornbury and Frampton Cotterell. Small world.
