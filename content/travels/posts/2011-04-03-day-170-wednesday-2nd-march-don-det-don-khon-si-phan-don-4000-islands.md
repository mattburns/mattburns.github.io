An hour and half longtail down the Mekong brought us to the island of Don Det. It’s the 4000 island’s answer to Vang Vieng as Don Khong is to Luang Prabang. Although both are on a much smaller scale there were the usual bedraggled hungover backpackers in their tubing vests, saggy hotpants and cigarettes hanging out their mouths loitering.

Can’t complain too much. Although our bungalow is basic and has a shared bathroom I am getting up-to-date with the blogs whilst lying in a hammock on the balcony with 180 degree views of the Mekong and across to Cambodia, and Matt’s snoozing in the hammock next to me. The only sounds are chicks scuffling around under our hut , longtails putt-putting by and only 4 tubers paddling around trying to work out which way is south. It’s a hard life.

Later that day…

Once again hired a couple of rickety bikes and cycled to the southern tip of Don Khon island. When you reach it after a 50min bumpy bicycle ride through Lao villages, across rice paddies, over the old French railway bridge passing school kids losing their flipflops whilst trying to brake on their bikes as their passenger is weighing heavily on their backs, and down the closed road past the steam rollers (oops) you reach the end of the road and sit on the edge of a concrete cliff to revel in the most fantastic views out over the water towards Cambodia. Only a handful of tourists are there and most of the village is out and about as the local boyracers with their longtails have brand-new engines and are cruising around with smug faces.

On our way back we spot the boyracing monks too – two in a speedboat pass under the French railway bridge as we ride over:

And a comedy sign gives warning to idiots.

Our mission to see the rare Irawaddy dolphins failed though as the sun was setting and we had no lights for the bike. But we have a backup plan as we have a chance to see them in Kratie, Cambodia.

On the plus side we get back to our hut cold beer in hand just in the nick of time to jump into our hammocks as the sun sets. Bliss.

No rest for the wicked though. We’re off to Cambodia….
