In Alleppey, the backwaters of Kerala, now after a very short train journey by Indian standards of 1hr 45mins at a ridiculously early time of 6:30.

Once again couldn’t sleep as I never can when we have to be up early to catch a plane or train. Matt on the other hand was almost out cold after drifting off whilst reading and smacking himself squarely on the nose with the e-reader. Another advantage of the good old-fashioned paperback – you can’t knock yourself out with a _real_ book. 

We had asked Rani to arrange a tuk-tuk at 6:00 as she’d said the ride to the station was 15mins and she’d kindly agreed to make us some breakfast to eat on the train. 5:59 we where downstairs in her dining room. “Sit down sit down” she smiled “5 mins 5 mins”. OK we can wait 5 mins no probs. Maybe 7 mins later her husband is bringing out the pile of food and wrapping it neatly in fake banana leaf. OK cool let’s go. They’re both back in the kitchen pottering about. Then he brings out 2 cups of sweet black tea. So we start trying to down this piping hot drink and Rani is smiling “hot yes”. Mmmm very nice and hot but we really ought to get going. 6.15 he’s got the engine running on his taxi and we’re off (funny tuk-tuk but nevermind). He keeps saying train 6:45, I keep saying no 6:30! Somehow after some shrewd James Bond manoeuvring driving side-by-side with another car for a few minutes and cunningly cutting in front we arrive with a couple of minutes to spare. Turns out the train in 10mins late anyway so our man was more right than we were.

Our surprise breakfast was a very thick rich sweet doughy pancake filled with warm banana and coconut. It was extremely messy for eating on a train but very tasty. Although even with my sweet tooth we couldn’t finish it. Was good to try it though and made a nice change to Tibetan bread, eggs and garlic potatoes which had been a frequent occurrence in Varkala (not knocking those either).

Now sat on a terrace in Palmy Residency in Alleppey watching a heron (I think) hanging out with a cow. Hakuna matata.

Alleppey is quite old skool India again. And we like it. I was surprised as it’s popular on the Kerala tourist route. Lots of traffic, feels a little polluted and shop after shop after shop. Majority of which are jewellers. Most are small but there is one huge white building which wouldn’t look out of place on the Vegas strip towering over the teeny shops that line the roads and canals. Maybe the start of things to come?

We have eaten in traditional canteen style eateries today with dirt-cheap food. Our dinner @ Hot Kitchen came to 120 rupees (£1.80). We were spending more on a set breakfast each in Varkala. 

**News flash:** Matt has bought some new flip flops! They were extremely expensive – 249 rupees (£3.60) – and they have soles.
