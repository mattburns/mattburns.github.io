It’s my birthday and my nan’s. Happy Birthday Nan!!

Early brekkie at the most basic cafe you can imagine with a lovely little family running it. We’d been here a couple of times before as the views are fantastic. The little girl is so cute. She can hardly be 1 year old and likes teetering around in her mum’s high heels.![IMG_2227](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMG_2227.jpg)

Hired the same moped again for 5 days. I am becoming a pro now :) And headed off to the farm for the 9am meeting. Lots of volunteers turned up to do temporary teaching this time plus Ben who had taught 2 weeks previously. 

I had my primary school class with two volunteers. Yvette & Nadja. We split the class in two and revised transport and animals. Nadja is a primary school teacher so she had some great songs up her sleeve. 

Back with Matt & he gave me my lovely pressies of a silver bangle, some lush flipflops, a green scarf and some mentos.

Then it was back to work. All the evening classes are now back to normal so I ended up teaching level 1s (ages 7 to 10) their ABCs with one of the Level 3 students. There weren’t enough classrooms so we sat in a circle outside on the grass. 

As there were a number of volunteers, I was able to leave earlier and was back by 18:30. Matt was nowhere to be seen. He was out scurrying around doing last minute birthday things. I cried when I saw what it was. He’d got everyone to email me personal messages saying Happy Birthday. It felt a little Big Brother like and I realised again how much I miss home and everyone. It was the best present. So thoughtful.

Plus the biggest chocolate muffin I’d ever seen as a birthday cake.

Later we went out for dinner at Elephant Crossing, a restaurant built over the river. And we had the most delicious bottle of red wine with our dinner. I may have said in previous blogs but it’s something we really miss. Wine is usually too expensive here and Beerlao is 80p for 660ml so guess which always wins. It was a real treat.

To follow our dinner we headed back and stuffed our faces with chocolate chip muffin. Mmmmm perfect end to a birthday :)
