I am writing this in retrospect and cannot believe it’s over a week since we did the camel trek. Time is flying by very fast.

Matt had a couple of days rest plus bought a course of antibiotics from the medical stall in the square for a quid and was ready to do the camel trek. We opted for a 1.5 day trek as we needed to get back by Monday afternoon for our trip to Delhi.
  
7.30am we were taken by open jeep (very cool vehicle – we all want one!) to a random place at the roadside about 30mins drive away where our camels and guides were waiting for us. We were legged-up straight onto the camels padded backs (dromedary rather bactrian). No instruction booklet provided. Just “lean back” as the camel gets up and down.
  
Immediately it felt easy to be sat atop these intriguing animals plodding through the barren land of routh dry soil and patches of grass and shrubs. I say barren – there were a few roads and electricity pylons plus wind turbines in the distance but it didn’t spoil it. We also passed nomadic people now and again living in a mud hut at the side of their crops.

Matt & Camel

My camel, Johnny Walker, was tied to the lead camel, Michael Jackson, so was pretty obedient and we seemed to be ahead of the pack for most of the trek. Matt on the other hand was given free “rein” and his camel (coincidentally also called Johnny – perhaps a family name?) would wander off on its own accord whenever it felt like it.
  
Michael seemed to be suffering from a severe bout of IBS so Johhny Walker’s nose (and my own) was filled with loud trumpets of hot air and suspicious aromas for 80% of the trip.

Camel!

After 3 hours and seeing a couple of gazelles and an eagle we stopped under a large tree to rest in the shade. It was a challenge getting off. Straddling a camel isn’t the most natural sitting position for any person so it can kind of rub a bit after a while.
  
The camels were unloaded of their saddles and blankets and ropes were tied around their front two legs so they hopped skipped and jumped off to chommp on some grass whilst we lazed around and drank masala chai and ate cabbage curry and chapati.
  
There were 5 of us on the trek. Nathalie from Holland and [Elizabeth and Tom][1] from London. Last September the latter two had left their jobs in PR and investment banking to take a world trip and India was their last country before heading home in December. It was great to meet another couple who were at the end of the adventure we are just beginning. They said it had been the best thing they had ever done and they were envious that we were at the start. They also said that India was the hardest country they’d travelled around so it would get easier from here. That was music to Matt’s ears! As although India is an interesting and diverse country it is so crazy and disorganised and hectic and exhausting. Tom and Elizabeth aren’t the only travellers to have said that to us either.

14:30 back on the camels for 3 more hours. Must say we did stop a couple of times in the morning and afternoon at ponds for the camels to have a drink. At one pool of water as we were leaving, some farmers were herding what must have been at least 100 cows towards the water’s edge.

It got much much hotter that afternoon and the fun idea of trekking on a camel was wearing thin as we grew sweatier and sweatier and our backsides ached more and more. At last at 5.30 we reached the Sam sand dunes where we were met by some poor bloke who’d walked from the nearest village to meet us with a huge sack of cold sodas and beers on his back. We were very grateful!

We sat on the hot sand and guzzled our Thumbs Up (a sweeter sicklier version of Coca Cola – Matt says he can’t tell the difference with normal coca cola though but no suprise there with his tastebuds). Surrounded by small holes in the sand we only had to wonder for 5 mins what had made them as the dung beetles starting emerging. I didn’t realise they could fly.

We watched the sun set over the dunes as the guides cooked us more food and masala chai and once we’d eaten and because it was now dark it was time for bed. At 19:30.
  
We laid our on duvets on the sand dunes looking up at the stars. I have never seen so many in my life. We could even clearly see the milky way. It was an humbling experience.
  
And even though we were out in the open with creepy crawlies around we weren’t bothered by them because we were in their environment. Not in some unclean hotel room. And we had a pretty good night’s sleep as the air was fresh and it even got a bit nippy – a refreshing change from the stifling heat in Jaisalmer.

Sunrise on the dunes

The next morning the sun rise was as spectacular as the sun set. The sillohuettes of the camels stood on the dunes with the early red sun behind them was beautiful.
  
Breakfast consisted of toast and jam and boiled eggs. We all politely ate an egg in true English style. Even though we knew there was a high risk of food-poisoning as the eggs had been tied to the back of Johnny Walker for the entire trip and our bottled water had heated during the day from ice-cold to luke-warm tea temperature so those eggs must have been half-boiled in the sun!

No-one wanted to get back on the camels though as we were still walking like John Wayne but we had to head off at 7.30am to stay as cool as possible for as long as possible. So Matt started experimenting with sitting positions and found facing backwards was an interesting alternative. Sideways seemed to be the winner though. I tried a number of times to maneouvre but it is bloody difficult to swing your leg over the front of a camel whilst its plodding up and down. (should have seen some of the non-photographs i took whilst sat on it). And the longer you’re sat in one position the heavier your legs become and the sorer your ass. Eventually I made myself swing sideways. Just out of sheer agony as i couldn’t stand it any more. And it was sooo much comfier. Typically we arrived back at the jeep half an hour later :)

The camel trek was amazing. The best bit was sleeping under the stars. If we could have done that for a couple more nights without having to trek anywhere we would have all jumped at it.

The sad thing was on the morning trek back to the jeep we saw a dead camel which must have collapsed on another trek. It was being eaten by crows. And it made me wonder how well the camels are actually looked after. A lot of animals here seem to be left and forgotten about once they get sick. But i don’t think that many people can afford medical treatment for themsleves let alone their animals. I was reading recently that 26% of indians can’t pay for treatment. There is no welfare support or nhs in this country.
  
We asked the guides how much a camel is to buy. 25-30k rupees. That’s about £500. To us that seems like nothing. To them it’s too much. They don’t own the camels. They can’t afford to. They get a monthly wage of 1500 ruppes – about £20. And that’s not a bad wage as some people in India get as little as 1 rupee a day. It’s screwed up completely.
