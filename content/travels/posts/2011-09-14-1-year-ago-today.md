…we were at Heathrow Terminal 5 sitting down and fastening our seatbelts on our flight to Delhi off on a round half the world adventure (which we almost missed because _someone_ had been distracted by the shiny things on display in the Sony shop).

We’ve had the most amazing year. Although we got back to the UK over 6 weeks ago, we are still travelling. Catching up with friends and family all over and seeing the UK from a different point of view. The view of having no home, no 9-5 job, no income & no car. And we still have no set plans. It’s as scary and as exciting as it was giving it all up last year. The world is our lobster as Matt would say. 

Guess we’ll have to get back to reality one day soon. But in the meantime we’ll continue [finding stolen cameras][1], sleeping in spare rooms, baking [cupcakes][2] and travelling the length and breadth of the country by megabus.

_Footnote: apologies for my extreme slackness in not updating the last 2 weeks of the blog. It’s extremely frustrating. I blame Mr Burns for not giving me copies of his photos from Japan so preventing me from finishing them off! Watch this space…they will be done before 2012 I promise…_
