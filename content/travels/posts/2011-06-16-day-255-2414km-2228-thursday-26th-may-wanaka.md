Here we go again. Another bad weather day.

Stayed in our van on our deserted campsite watching the clouds float across the hills working on [SCF][1].

Didn’t do anything really all day except a half hour walk to the lake and back via New World supermarket. Fun stuff.

Ever heard of a battered lasagne? No, nor us. They sell them in New World. Taste like a deep-fried lasagne, bizarrely.
