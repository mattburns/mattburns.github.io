Backwater trip today. Before we’d even had breakfast we had our plans sorted. Volker Schmidt, a guy staying at Palmy Residency, asked us if we’d like to join him on a motor boat he’d hired as it was too big for one person. It made sense as we were going to look into doing a boat trip anyway. We have met lots of people with interesting jobs and Volker’s sounded pretty impressive – director & writer (previously actor) in Berlin and Vienna.

We opted for 4 hours drifting around the backwaters of Alleppey. The journey started in the North canal which is extremely p0lluted and smelly but 5 mins West and we were out of the main town and in the beautiful backwaters of coconut palms, banana trees, rice paddies, fishermen, chickens and goats searching for food, small brightly coloured houses and Vodafone adverts. Yes Vodafone signs were everywhere.&nbsp; Vodafone have you no conscience? I’ve not been to Venice can’t imagine floating around on the canals there you are bombarded with adverts for mobile telephony. Because it spoils the natural beauty. Grrrr.

Gripes aside it was a lovely relaxing 4hr trip, even the 3hrs of raindrops on the water added to the chill out effect. It was interesting to see the residents of the backwaters going about their daily business. Washing clothes, washing themselves, paddling canoes and having a ciggie or two, workmen diving for mud to build up the defences along the rice paddies, a church filled with a congregation singing hymns with groups of men loitering outside.

Plus the ducks. Every so often there would be a swathe of ducks across the water squawking away. (Yes that person is wearing a pink umbrella hat – common in the rice paddies).

Isla & Neil had recommended taking a houseboat trip for 24hrs and we saw a lot of them whilst on our modest trip. We could see the attraction. They are amazing creations. Floating luxury. Nothing like the canal boats in Britain. At one time there were 6 or 7 coming towards us and we felt like we were going into battle! We saw four guys fixing the roof of another houseboat by hand. Everything is hand-made here.&nbsp; But we couldn’t justify the cost of 5000 rupees so that will have to wait for another day. Here is a local guy in his canoe being towed by a houseboat – they’re monsters of the backwaters.
