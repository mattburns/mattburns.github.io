I can’t be bothered to go into the fiasco at Margao Residency. All-in-all we got there at 8am and didn’t get our room until 10am so were pretty pissed off knackered peeps by then. 2hrs probably doesn’t sound that bad but try 2hrs when you have been in a sleeper bus for 10hrs followed by a cafe for 3hours and you’re feeling icky. 

Finally found that beaches do exist in Goa :) Got the sardine bus to Benaulim town, walked the 15 mins to the beach, found a beach bar called Rogers and drank beer for 2 hours looking at the sand & sea and the package-holiday beach whales lying on their sunloungers snapping their fingers at waiters to bring them more beers. Ever so Costa Del Sol-like but had a good vibe.

Walked along the huge sandy beach north to Colva which is more commercial and has many cheesy beach bars with less character and dodgy food (where we ate anyway).

A lady from St Petersburg asked Matt to take her photo and then proceeded to tell us every place she’d been to on her 3 month trip around India. She was fascinating and I think she wanted someone to talk to as she was travelling alone. She seemed to have enjoyed it but her main gripe was the lack of meat on the menus! Also she’d gone trekking through the jungle with a young guide who told her to leg it for 4km as there were leeches and being a 61-year old she couldn’t run particularly fast she’d ended up recuperating for 10 days. Glad we haven’t met any leeches yet.&nbsp; 

Wednesday we caught our last train in India. This time it was an all-dayer as couldn’t get an overnighter and after a pretty comfortable 12hr journey we arrived in Mumbai, which felt like a good city from the moment we stepped off the train.
