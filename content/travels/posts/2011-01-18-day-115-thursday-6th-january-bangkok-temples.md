Our overnight VIP bus from Krabi to Bangkok had 3 seats per row with lots of room, blankets, free coffee & bun, water and free dinner. Not that we realised all of this until we got on the bus. We’d stuffed ourselves beforehand so a stop with free buffet was a surprise.

Another surprise came at 3am when the onboard hostess tapped me on the head twice to wake me and give me a refreshing towel. Followed by coffee. Bit of a shock to the system.

The bus arrived at Bangkok eastern bus terminal at 4.45am and Matt found a local bus (no. 511) going to Banglamphu. By 5.30am we were wandering the streets of Bangkok looking for accommodation. Passing pissed people still drinking in Khao San and taxi drivers and ladyboys. The place was buzzing for such an early time.

Nowhere had room. Well except for one but in the 10mins it took us to wander out and decide and wander back in some other people got in there. We tried a 24hour internet cafe where the the guy working there was asleep dribbling onto his desk.&nbsp; Found a direction to walk in and was about to head there when we decided to try our first choice Siam again. They had a room! It would be ready at 8 so we sat and had brekkie in our zombie state until it was ready. By that time the drinkers had been replaced with breakfasters and people checking out of hotels.

As always we headed out to do some sightseeing at the hottest time of the day – 12:00 – and boiled ourselves whilst walking to the Grand Palace. After munching on some delicious crab ball kebabs we covered ourselves up with trouser legs (Matt) and shawl (Karen) to comply with the no bare shoulders/legs rules and wandered through the gates. Only to be stopped by a guard who told me a shawl wasn’t good enough and I had to queue and borrow a top. Grrrr. After 15mins of queuing we then saw that it cost a fortune to actually get into the place anyway so we turned around and left. 

And ended up in an amazing place for a 7th of the price called Wat Pho with a gigantic golden reclining Buddha, temples and many many small Buddha statues being painstakingly restored with gold leaf. It was beautiful. We donated 20THB to get a pot of small coins that you dropped in larger pots situated all the way down the back of the building making a wish for each one.

We must have spent a good couple of hours wandering around Wat Pho so that was us templed out. Nearby there was a ferry stop so we returned to the hotel via the river. View from the ferry stop – another temple which we didn’t visit.</p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p> </p>
