Saturday I went off for the morning with Aly to what I thought was advertising her charity in town. But when she said into town she didn’t mean Siem Reap. To her that is the city. A town is a smaller place west of Siem reap on the outskirts called ???? which in English means&nbsp; “Basket”.

So I hopped on the back of her moped and away we went.

She introduced me to some of the families who weave baskets in this area. Many of them have orders already from different companies. Many have their own “niche” of basket weaving. It depends whom they have learnt from.

This family of weavers made small basket for holding pencils and the like. They charged 1,000 riel (25¢) for a pot, Aly & I bought one each and she may come back to get more. They were beautifully made. ![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/05/P1060064.jpg)

Next door they wove toilet roll holders for $3 each. It was too expensive for our pockets but the lady there already had an American buyer so why charge any less?

This family were weaving large baskets on their doorstep for $2.50 each. The guy is stripping the wood and sizing it. The lady is making it into a saleable item. It takes a day to make one basket.

These baskets are filled with fruit and gifts as presents for people.

We met a group of women making rice wine holders. They had been given a sample box and were trying to copy it with the Angkor Wat temple woven on it. They were charging 3,000 riel (75¢) for each rice wine holder. Matt and I had seen the same holder sold in a Siem Reap supermarket with including a bottle of rice wine for $11. Rice wine is normally $4 to $5 per bottle.

Aly showed me the land she owned nearby where she wishes to build a home for her family away from the city.

She also took me to a shop selling traditional local goods for a lot more money than they’d paid the local people for.

And we popped to her old school in Siem Reap where she used to teach before opening up her own school to pick up her young daughter Sandra so then there were were 3 on the moped.
