As well as being Valentine’s Day today it is 6 years today since our “non-date” in Wagamamas in Bristol when we hoped no-one we knew would pass the window and spot us just being 2 “friends” out for a meal on what just happened to be Valentine’s Day.

Since then I’ve had the most amazing years ever. And I’m so glad that Matt was up for the same mad plan of giving up everything and going travelling. I’m having the best time with the perfect guy. I’m a very lucky girl.

Love you loads Mr Burns!
