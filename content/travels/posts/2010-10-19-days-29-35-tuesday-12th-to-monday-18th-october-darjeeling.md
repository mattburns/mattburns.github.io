“A number of rewarding and picturesque treks are accessible from Darjeeling. October and November’s clear skies and warm temperatures make it an ideal time to trek…” says the Lonely Planet. 

We wouldn’t know. For the past few days we have wanted to go on the Singalila trek where you can walk to a height of 3600m at Sandakphu and see the top of Everest clearly but the weather is beating us. The rain has followed us from the UK and it won’t go away!

We arrived in Darjeeling last Monday. After a long, overnight train journey from Varanasi to New Jalpaiguri we jumped in the back of a jeep (no seatbelts) with 7 other passengers and our backpacks secured to the roof and 3hrs, 2200m, a stop at a hillside cafe to pour water on the steaming engine and some very bumpy roads we reached Darjeeling train station. Just in time to catch the steam engine rolling out down the hill.

The views were spectacular. The rolling mountains and colourful hillside buildings were breathtaking. This place is unlike any other in India (that we have seen so far). Relaxing, chilled, no hassle, no touts. <strike>Less</strike> Fewer people, friendlier, more varied people who look indian, nepalese and tibetan. 

We made our way up the steep winding road to what feels like the top of Darjeeling and found our Hotel Tranquility, run by a lovely guy who put us at ease immediately. We stayed in one of the back rooms the first night as it was the only one available but he told us he’d move us as soon as a better room became available. Sure enough the next day our bags were moved to a room with a view. And what a view. It’s like being on top of the world!

Tuesday to Thursday we felt we needed to acclimatise. Going from 119m to 2134m in one go was more of&nbsp; shock to the system than we’d anticipated. We suffered in both similar and different ways.&nbsp; Our sinuses were blocked and we kept sneezing. I felt dizzy and sick and Matt has had a crappy cough since we arrived which is only just getting better.

After a few days we started looking into doing a trek. We had thought about going up to Sikkim but then decided to try the Singalila trek first to see how we got on. The only problem was the weather took a turn for the worst on Thursday so we thought we’d leave it until after the we weekend when the forecast looked to be improving. 

Haha. Yesterday you could hardly see anything outside of the window the clouds were so thick. Today it was brighter so we popped to the zoo around lunchtime. 90mins later it was belting it down and the rainclouds quickly descended around us until the air was a heavy dew. We had our raincoats so we trundled around the zoo looking at soggy red pandas and dripping wet himalayan wolves.&nbsp; It was a lovely zoo though. Most of the enclosures were a good size for the animals they housed and they were very similar to their natural habitat with lots of trees, plants and rocks. Nothing like the concrete enclosures in many British Zoos. The Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park has a number of breeding programs to help endangered species such as the Snow Leopard, the Red Panda, Tibetan Wolf and the Himalayan Newt (these guys could swim fast!).

The Himalayan Mountaineering Institute (HMI) was also inside the grounds and told the stories of the attempts to climb Everest up to the first successful one in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hilary and local man Tenzing Norgay who barely gets a mention anywhere else. It was amazing the amount of equipment those guys had to take with them. We thought it was a shame that the flag they’d left there was now in that museum!

One thing we have learned in India, especially in Darjeeling, is that it takes FOREVER to make a cup of chai. Today in the HMI “restaurant” was a record 45 mins. Ridiculous. We’d thought we just pop in for a quick drink whilst it was tipping it down. In Britain, when you order food and drink, the drink usually comes first. Not here. You’re usually halfway through your meal before your cuppa materialises! 

Another thing we’ve discovered in Darjeeling is fab street-food. The delicious freshly steamed vegetable momos, the deep-fried pastry filled with beans and onion that looks like a flat pasty covered in chilly sauce and scrumptious egg rolls complete with chopped carrot and cucumber, tomato sauce and of course the obligatory chilly sauce. Delicious! 

We have also discovered Cake Lady! She makes the best chocolate brownies ever. We met her by accident in Hot Pizza Place as she brought along her 30th cake delivery of the day. A traveller (from Oz we think) she is probably younger than us and came to Darjeeling a couple of years ago. Travelled on around India but loved this place so much she came back and 18 months later is still here. Her cake business came from the idea that there are hardly any decent cakes in Darjeeling. We have to almost agree with her. The large chocolate topped doughnuts available in lots of street stalls are pretty tasty. But Cake Lady cakes and biscuits have an edge. Her business plan seems to be to make the cakes to order and sell them out of restaurants and cafes all over Darjeeling. Genius. We must find out her name if we can before we leave. 

Have you noticed we’re eating a lot of cake here? We will be appearing fatter in our photos very soon I promise.

Apart from eating lots of cake and eating lots of other things we haven’t done a great deal else in Darjeeling. Our one other touristy day other than the zoo today was what we came here for. The toy train. We took the “joyride” 2hr 30min round trip from Darjeeling to Ghoom and back in 1st class where the seat backs switched direction depending on which way the train was facing. The train chugged it’s way up the toy track and stopped halfway to take on more water. With the windows open for lots of photographic moments, we often got covered in water and soot. Yes it was very sad. We felt like an old couple taking a steam engine for fun but it was fun and if it’s good enough for Michael Palin it’s good enough for us! :)

The photos paint a better picture:

<photo coming here soon>&nbsp; 

So in 7 days in Darjeeling we have been on a train and to the zoo and that’s about it. It’s amazing how much time goes by doing nothing at all. I am feeling pretty guilty that we’re not doing something more constructive. But its difficult when most things here are reliant on the weather being good. We really didn’t appreciate the view of Khangchendzonga (8598m – 3rd highest in Himalaya) on our first day in Darjeeling. Since then we haven’t had a glimpse. Fingers-crossed the sun comes out soon otherwise we’ll start looking like enormous American tourists with our bellies full of Cake Lady goodies.

More photos of darjeeling to come later…
