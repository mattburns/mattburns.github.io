Thought for the day

It’s 6pm on Sunday evening and I am sat at the Vista wifi cafe in Vientiane surrounded by laptops. Virtually every table is staring at one (me included) even whilst eating dinner there are people leaning across their plates typing away. They’re not sat alone either. (I currently am. Matt is off wandering for an hour as it’s our anniversary tomorrow so he’s doing some shopping I assume).

What a world we live in. Well what a world we “lucky” ones from the developed world live in. Of course I am surrounded by tourists. You hardly see a Lao resident with a laptop (although we may see more now we’re in the capital city). After teaching in basic classrooms and passing basic housing where families live altogether it makes me feel shit to be sat here sipping my beer whilst I type this.

As we left Phoom Chai Guest House today the young boy there jumped on the tuk tuk and gave us a gift – a sticky rice bamboo pot with Phoom Chai G.H. written on it and he shook our hands. how sweet is that? Coincidentally we’d bought two yesterday as we are both addicted to the stuff and plan to make lots of it when we get back. So now we have three! ( I feel more shopping coming on).

We took a minivan from Vang Vieng to Vientiane. 11 passengers and 1 driver and all the bags piled high on the roof. We stopped once for the bags to be readjusted and another time some of us had to get out so that he could drive over a huge bump in the road without damaging the van. It was an easy way to get to Vientiane. 

Arriving late afternoon a lot of the guest houses have been full but we found room at the Youth Inn 2 on Francois Nginn road. It’s basic but will do until tomorrow when we hope to move next door to somewhere with more than a brick wall view out of the window.
