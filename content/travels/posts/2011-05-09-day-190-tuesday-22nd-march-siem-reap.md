After 2 days of temples we are all templed-out. We decide to spend the day doing not much.

So I decide to treat myself to a haircut. My first haircut in 7 months. 

I drop by the local hairdressers. Not the one just outside Palm Garden Lodge (there were no customers and since going back in April it has turned into AB Bar with a red strip light and pretty ladyboys so probably wasn’t doing such a good job as a hair salon – this has no reflection on Palm Garden Lodge) but the one just down the road towards town. She was happy to cut my hair there and then. I had it cut, dyed black, head massaged and hair straightened for $10. It took almost 2 hours and I delayed a poor girl who was getting her nails done. The most beautiful black varnish with white & yellow daisies painted on. 

And what a life-saver. I now have jet black hair, dead-ends gone, no grey hair and it was straight for at least 5 mins. Until the humidity set in and it rained but who cares. No grey!

The storms hit again today. 

This time we were enjoying a cheeky beverage out front of the famous Temple Club on Pub Street (a despicable westernised street of bars & restaurants in the centre of Siem Reap which could be anywhere in the world) and the thick humid air gave way to a drenching of water. By about 2am, whilst the tuk-tuk touts donned their waterproofs and tried to hide, a couple of drinkers started dancing in the street which caught on pretty quickly and there were loads of us – tourists & streetkids – dancing and splashing about outside the club as the water filled the street and Black Eyed Peas – Tonight’s gonna be a good night – boomed from the stereo. Unreal. 

YMCA killed the moment for us and a bedraggled Matt & Karen (ala frizzy locks) went back in for a final 50c beer before heading home. Except that Matt was cunningly conned (or so he makes out) by the waiter into ordering a rum & coke to get a free t-shirt. OK Matt says I’ll have rum & coke and she’ll have a beer pointing at the menu. Only when the guy had trotted off to the bar with our order did we realise which side of the menu we’d ordered from (and hence the free t-shirt)…
