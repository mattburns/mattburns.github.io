Almost forgot to say about the Moeraki boulders. How could I forget? A strange phenomenon on a beach in a small place called Moeraki just south of Oamaru. A kind of stop for 5 minutes if you’re passing type of place. 

Here’s the obligatory silly photo of Karen, this time with her over-sized white trainers on (the only “sensible” shoes I have on this trip).
