We arrived in Jaisalmer at 10pm. We left Mt Abu at 8am. 14 bloody hours it took to get here!
  
The Lonely Planet says there is a direct bus from Mt Abu to Jaisalmer which takes 11 hours. There isn’t.
  
The Lonely Planet says there are A/C buses available. There aren’t.
  
We sat on a hot sweaty bus for 7hrs to Jodphur. Bumping up and down and all over the place. Stopping for any person who decided they wanted to get on or off.
  
We had one “loo”stop. I say “loo” in the looses of terms. I almost gagged it was so disgusting. That was when I almost lost it and got a bit emotional. I ended up going back to it because it was the only option available to find another lady just doing her business in the middle of the block and gesturing to me to do the same. I have used some grotty loos in my time but that one takes the biscuit!
  
On arriving in Jodphur we were bombarded with more taxi drivers and I almost lost it again. I just wanted my personal space and some peace and quiet. Things that seem rare over here which is why the trek up the Araveli (*need to check this name out) mountains was a lifesaver and a definite highlight.

We made our way to the train station where the LP said there were travel places to try and book our next bus. 3rd time lucky, the LP was right and we found the Maradev travels place. The guy was really helpful and we booked onto the 4.45 bus so had 45 mins to get some grub. Found a lovely restaurant in amongst all the crappy buildings and ordered some nice western bland food as we were going to be travelling on another bus. I ordered Aubergine & Vegetable au gratin. Well it was a good job I wasn’t that hungry as we worked out they may have got their “pommes” and “pomme de terres” mixed up and completely forgot the aubergine. It was basically a bowl of bechemal sauce with about 10 peas, two chunks of carrot and a sliced up apple! If we’d had more time we would have complained but we were in a rush. When leaving the guy asked why we hadn’t eaten it and I explained about the apple and it was a bit sweet but he was adamant it was aubergine. Funny tasting aubergine is all I can say. It would have made an interesting dessert!!

Onto the next bus station and to the bus to Jaisalmer. We were told to put our backpacks in the boot of the bus. Only to then be asked for 10 rupees for a “guarantee”. Bugger off we said and Matt brought the bags back onto the bus so we could “guarantee” them ourselves.
  
That’s one thing that’s been a running theme in India. Asking for money for anything. Probably because we are blatantly tourists. We get stared at a lot. People walk by us on the bus just to have a look at us. The kids are quite sweet when they come and say hello but the adults you feel are going to try and get something out of you for nothing. That was what was so refreshing about Charles from the trek yesterday. He was so different to most of experiences.
  
Anyway the rest of the bus journey was pretty uneventful. We had no curtains on the windows this time so managed to see a lot of the countryside and more towns and villages. They all look very similar. Very dusty and half-finished buildings everywhere. And lots and lots of rubbish. There were people sat on top of our bus and we could see them throwing packets over the side as the bus drove on. It’s so sad that it seems to be the norm to leave rubbish wherever you are. With the mentality I guess that someone else will clear it up. But it seems that brush and brush and brush to clear the rubbish to the edge of their village and leave it there accumulating. We see the animals foraging around in the piles of rubbish, chewing plastic bags. I really don’t know what the solution is. Where would it go? To a landfill site like in the UK? Or to another country also like in the UK? 

I know I am sounding pretty negative in this entry but I think there has to be lows as well as highs so you can appreciate the good stuff even more.

Luckily once in Jaisalmer things are looking up. For a change we’d booked ahead so we were met at the bus station and taken straight here to Hotel Renuka. Which contrastly is lovely, clean and has friendly staff and a rooftop restaurant with great views of the main fort. Feeling much happier now. Although Matt is poorly at the moment poor thing. We hope he’s feeling better soon for an overnight camel trek.
