Gave Matt a break from driving and I did it all today. Why I chose the one day we had to drive 10km on gravel track 1.5 cars wide is beyond me. Still we survived.

Left our exciting car park nice and early (well 7:30) to go to Totaranui beach at the north-western tip of the Abel Tasman national park. Because it was an unsealed road for 10km it took bloody ages and wound round and round, left and right up and down. We almost gave up and thought it can’t be worth all of this can it? Yep:

Note the NZ marmite on my toast. Matt hates it I love it. I’m going to have to import it when I get back home. Matt has My Mate on toast. It’s in a Marmite jar and was made in the UK but isn’t called Marmite. Confused? We were. Hence the two different yeast-based products.

Had to get a walk in of course so managed a nice 10min one along the beach to “Skinner Point” where Matt took some arty photos of the ferns and also “saved” someone’s speedos thinking it was a handbag.

The problem with unsealed roads that go to the coast. You have to come back the same way. Spotted these colourful public conveniences this time round.

Back in Takaka we headed for a closer tourist attraction called the Pupu Pupu Springs. Yes it was pretty but nothing to write home about so I won’t.

Takaka itself is a sweet little town with lots of art & craft shops and lovely cafes. Of course we couldn’t resist the smell of good coffee. Although me being me had to try the odd thing on the menu and went for Dandelion Latte. Very similar to Chai Latte but with a tinge of bitterness from the dandelion. A hit I think. Definitely something I’d have again. But it won’t be, because The Dangerous Kitchen in Takaka is the only place they make it as the owner roasts the dandelions himself. 

The plan was to go to the West coast today but ran out of time (and almost diesel) so back to Nelson and the trusty free I-Site carpark via a road-side fruit stall with honesty box. Kiwis, pears and apples for $2.

We have a wifi connection again so getting up-to-date with blogs and more [SCF][5] work.
