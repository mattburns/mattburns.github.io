We arrived early on Sunday morning being dropped off in a derelict backstreet yard. It was still dark so we could have been in Timbuktu for all we knew.

Luckily our guys at Palm Garden Lodge were awake and sent Mr. Long to meet us in his tuk tuk. 20 mins later we were snoozing in a lovely comfy room and 3 hours later we were eating noodle soup for breakfast. 

By 11:00 we were on our way to do the “big circuit” of temples starting with Banteay Srei.

The ticket system for the Angkor temples is both strange and brilliant. It’s kind of like a drive-thru. Your tuk-tuk pulls up in front of the kiosks, you queue for a couple of minutes, get your photo taken on a webcam and they print your ticket. You hop back on your tuk tuk and you’re away. The weird bit is the fact you can buy a 1 day ticket for $20 or a 3-day ticket for $40. We only wanted to do 2 days so it worked out the same either way. The second weird bit is you can get a 3-day consecutive ticket or an any 3 days in a 7-day period ticket for the same price. Why have both?!

Anyway off we tootle with Mr. Long 35km to Banteay Srei which was pretty amazing. Very ornate carvings. It was worth the trip and was one of our favourite temples.

On the way back to the main temple area we stopped at the [Cambodian Landmine museum][5] set up by a guy with the most incredible past. Once a child soldier in the Khmer Rouge who laid landmines, he now spends his time locating and decommissioning landmines.

Our tour took us past Eastern Mebon, Ta Som and Preah Khan and ended today at Phnom Bakheng on top of a hill overlooking Angkor.

Quite a few of the temples were still crumbling and had to be held up by makeshift scaffolding.

Climbing up Phnom Bakheng for the sunset over Angkor.

No photos of the sunset unfortunately. It was cloudy and there are a lot of trees in the way. Plus Angkor Wat is in the opposite direction and hardly visible from here. Good exercise though.

Stopping off on the way home to fill up with gas. It’s normal to buy petrol from a barrel or an old glass Coca Cola bottle on the side of the road.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_3972.jpg)

More temples tomorrow bright and early with Mr. Long.
