Had a very constructive day doing admin type stuff.

Picked up our passports from the Immigration office and we are now permitted to stay in Laos until 10th March. 

Arranged a way of leaving Vientiane (bus to Tha Khaek tomorrow). As lovely as it is 5 nights is enough when there is so much more of Laos to see. We have been staying at [Mixay Paradise Guest House][1] so long now that we were eligible for a free coffee and muffin this afternoon!

Finally changed the dates of our remaining flights. Very very very happy about that. When we booked our RTW tickets last June we couldn’t book more than 11 months in advance so most of our flights were bunched up in May and June. Plus our next flight out of Bangkok was for 17th March but we wanted to change it so that we can see Wendy & Steve on 27th March. Anyway we love SE Asia so much that we’re cutting down our NZ leg from 4 to 2 months and staying here til 2nd May. We thought we’d have to pay some ridiculous amount in admin fees but Qantas in Bangkok changed it all for free. Such a relief.

For anyone remotely interested the new dates are on the [Itinerary][2] page.
