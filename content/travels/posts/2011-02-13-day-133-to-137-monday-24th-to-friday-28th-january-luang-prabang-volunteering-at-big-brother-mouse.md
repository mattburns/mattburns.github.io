After 7 days in Luang Prabang we are still not ready to leave. This has to be one of our favourite places of the trip for easy living. It is a beautiful place and the people are so friendly. 

I have been volunteering at [Big Brother Mouse][1], a local charity which creates books for kids in Lao and English. They encourage tourists to buy books from their shop or from the market to give to kids who live in villages. If you have enough money you can sponsor a “book party” where they go to a village and tell the kids about books, play games with them and let them select a book each. Or you can sponsor a book itself to get it published. Unfortunately I don’t have that kind of money at the moment but fortunately it’s possible to help out in other ways. So I spent 2 hours every morning this week going to their office and chatting to young Lao people who want to improve their English. They were mainly 18 & 19 year old students and one or two locals who are working in tourism.

It was a really interesting experience. Pretty much every day you’d get asked the same questions. What is your name? Where do you come from? How long are you in Luang Prabang? Where are you travelling. But you’d also get asked many different things. Some of the guys there asked for meanings of words from a brochure they’d found. Like “sanctuaries”, “fermenting” and “nonetheless” – try explaining those in simple English! Another seemed to be reading through his Lao-English dictionary so would ask how to pronounce words like assiduous and also ask the meaning. I still haven’t looked that one up yet so if anyone knows, please post in the comments bit at the bottom!

Another asked me what I thought of gay relationships. Then asked whether I thought he looked gay! Because he hangs around with his best mate who is gay and lots of people say he looks it! 

Sompanh, a student, was there 4 days in a row and one day he read me part of a traditional Lao story so that I could help with pronunciation and meaning of some words. It was quite a young story about a boy named Toukata who lived in the forest, married a girl who appeared from an egg and had to compete with the god of the city for her hand in marriage by having a cock-fight. Toukata’s cock turned into a wolf so he won his wife back. 

He also asked me to read two pages he’d written in English. One was an overview about himself and his family and how he’d built the bottom floor of the family home. He lives in Luang Prabang away from his family who live in a village in the hills. He goes to school every weekday, has extra English classes on Saturdays and works as a night watchman in a guest house from 9pm til 7am every night. To build part of the family home, he had to cycle home every Saturday and work on it for 90mins before cycling back to Luang Prabang to work. And he comes to Big Brother Mouse when he can fit it in. This week he could come every day because they had a week’s holiday. 

I was utterly gobsmacked how eager these guys are to study and learn English. On Thursday night I bought a few books from the Big Brother Mouse market stall. The guy selling them happened to be the illustrator of one of the books I bought. 

I bought Doctor Dolittle (in Lao & English) and hoped to give it to Sompanh on Friday. I couldn’t believe it he wasn’t there. I feared it was because on Thursday he’s not been able to get a word in edgeways as I had 3 of them to talk to and his friend just wouldn’t shut up. He was very strongly opinionated about many things. Especially about how you should use your free time. You should study and help out at home instead of playing computer games and playing football. He couldn’t see the benefit of doing some sport. He was the best English speaker there so maybe he had a point?!

Anyway Friday I ended up speaking to a variety of people as there was only me and one other volunteer there. Usually 4 or 5 turned up. But Sompanh wasn’t there. I guess he needed a day off.

Instead I spoke to a trainee English teacher who was completely disillusioned by the whole thing. He didn’t feel he was being taught the right skills and that he would just have to go into it blindly. Really he wanted to run his own travel business but it was too late, he had already started the teacher course and had to complete it. I told him about the teaching techniques I’d learned in my TEFL course and although he was interested he said there was no way he could play any games or anything. He had to follow the book.

That is one thing that I have found everyone has the same opinion on here. Lao teachers of English don’t know enough English to teach it properly. And it is taught in such a dull way that they don’t learn. Which is why many go to Big Brother Mouse.

Finally to conclude my Big Brother Mouse experience I chatted to a guy who had just started working at a Luang Prabang restaurant and needed to improve his English. It was his first time at Big Brother Mouse and he struggled to understand much of what I was saying. However he had a list of words from the menu which he wanted to me to pronounce for him. Amongst others they consisted of “sticky rice, strawberry hibiscus and scratch*”. A very strange list of words but he seemed pleased to have learned how to say them. As time was up he started panicking and saying, tell me 2 more words in English.&nbsp; Like what? I asked. Anything, anything he said. How do you think of 2 words just there on the spot?? I suddenly remembered I had the books in my bag and one was an A-Z of English words with pictures. I pulled it out and the first page it landed on was the letter G. He started poring over it and pointing at words. “Glove, glass, etc”. He seemed happy to have learned 2 completely random words. 

So I gave him the A-Z book to keep. That was what it was meant for. To help a Lao person learn English. I cannot describe the look of delight on his face. I almost cried. He was so so grateful and ecstatic that he could keep this book. He kept saying Kop Jai (thank you) over and over with his palms together and bowing his head. He wanted me to go to his restaurant Utopia this evening to see him at work. We didn’t make it there but it’s so good to know that I may have helped someone get a bit closer to where they want to go. 

_* whilst in Vang Vieng I spotted a menu that said “all our dishes are made from scratch”. Now it makes sense!_
