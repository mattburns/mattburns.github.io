We left Isla & Neil’s around lunchtime laden down with oranges freshly picked from the garden and headed to Northland. 

It was absolutely peeing it down.

I am writing this in retrospect and can’t for once remember what we actually did apart from stop for petrol & supermarket supplies in Warkworth and go to a campsite in Ruakaka. Which sounds like a pretty boring afternoon. But I guess every day can’t be filled with exciting moments.
