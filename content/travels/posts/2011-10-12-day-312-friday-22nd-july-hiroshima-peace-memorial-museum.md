Spent the morning at the Peace Memorial Museum, a very modern building containing some of the most horrific sights I have ever seen.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/10/P1080279.jpg)

You are shown information about the lead-up to the day the A-bomb was dropped. Who made the bomb, who made the decisions on where and when to drop it and why. I am still shocked at how that was decision was made. It was an experiment. An unknown. How would it affect human life? It was a lottery. It had to be dropped. It cost too much money to just not bother. It was chosen based on the fact there were no prisoner of war camps in the area. It was a clear day so that the results could be recorded easily.

A way to get Japan to surrender. They had no warning of the A-bomb. They surrendered afterwards.  I don’t claim to know anything about the Second World War but nothing can justify this.

The second part of the exhibition shows the aftermath. The effects of the bomb.

Looking at the remains of a wall peppered with glass from the force of the blast, a museum guide asked us where we were from and told us about the many many children who had been working outside that day. Digging trenches to prevent fire spreading if bombs were dropped. All completely exposed to the effects of the A-bomb.

I had to leave halfway through. There were only so many charred remains of children’s clothing, toys, satchels I could look at.

Watching videos of survivors talking about that day, it is difficult to comprehend what they went through.

According to the exhibition the number of nuclear warheads in the world as of January 2009 are:

  </tr>

Plus India, Pakistan & Israel have a few each too.

Aren’t these WMDs?

Leaving this exhibition I felt ashamed to be British.

I am writing this on 11th October 2011. Almost 3 months after visiting the museum. And it still brings a lump to my throat thinking about it. And it is agonizing to know that it could happen again.
