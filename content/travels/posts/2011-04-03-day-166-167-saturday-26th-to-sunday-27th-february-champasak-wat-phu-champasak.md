After a nice lie-in, the first in a while, a good banana pancake for brekkie from the local Indian, also a first in a while, and an excellent cup of coffee we jumped in a “remork-moto” to the new market (Talat Dao Heung) bus station. There have been many different designs of tuk-tuk in Lao and this was our first sat aside a motorbike in a 2 person carriage that looks like it might from a ferris wheel. It was surprisingly fast and manoeuvred around other traffic in an agile fashion.

There was a sorng thaew there already filled with passengers, shopping bags of baguettes and rugs. We squeezed on the back whilst our backpacks joined the piled roof covered with chicken baskets and sacks of produce. It was 13:30 by then and we were peckish but with no luck finding a noodle joint we’d resigned ourselves to waiting til we got to Champasak. Then we had an idea to grab some sticky rice to keep us going. So Matt armed with our Phoom Chai g.h. pot had it topped up at a market stall. It’s a pretty good snack really. A little bland maybe without a tasty sauce for dipping but fills the gap.

Surprisingly it only took an hour to get from Pakse to Champasak. They’re improving the roads so half of it was brand new tarmac. The other half we were pretty much off-roading along an old dusty track alongside the main road. 

The guys on the sorng thaew couldn’t have been more helpful and dropped us off exactly where we wanted to be so it took us 2 mins to find a really good guest house Khampouy with free tea and Lao coffee plus help yourself fridge of drinks and pay when you leave. Needless to say we sampled 4 bottles of Beerlao and completely cleaned them out that night.

Whilst sat on our verandah with one of the said Beerlao the sky was so clear you could see many stars and suddenly the brightest shooting star we’ve ever seen flashed overhead. What a sight. We waited for more but that seemed to be the only one. We’d just witnessed a near-miss extinction of planet Earth. (Slight exaggeration ;) but it was a good-sized flash of light!)

And no we weren’t so drunk that we imagined it. Just merry :)

Still Sunday we both were a bit hanging but we made ourselves get a moped and go to visit one of the “most important archaeological sites in Laos” -LP. Wat Phu Champasak. There is not a lot of it left and it is crumbling further due to water saturation however the setting was fantastic. There are 3 levels. The first are two reservoirs with a central walkway which continues past 2 large Khmer style buildings. Then steep steps take you up to the next level with a Buddha protecting the gate. Another set of even steeper disrupted steps with gnarled Frangipani trees either side look like something out of a Tim Burton film and at the top there is the “sanctuary” another very old building plus three rocks with an elephant, a crocodile and Buddha’s foot sculpted into them. From this level you can see for miles and miles and miles across Laos. It was so peaceful there. And the hoards of crowds which the LP warned of never appeared. ![IMG_2979](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_2979.jpg)&nbsp;![IMG_2992](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_2992.jpg)&nbsp;![IMG_2994](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_2994.jpg)&nbsp;![IMG_3020](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_3020.jpg)&nbsp;![IMG_3030](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_3030.jpg) 

For anyone visiting Champasak just be aware there is hardly anywhere to eat a meal near the guesthouses. We tried to find somewhere different each meal and always ended up in the restaurant opposite Khampouy guest house which did lovely food although they only ever had chicken.
