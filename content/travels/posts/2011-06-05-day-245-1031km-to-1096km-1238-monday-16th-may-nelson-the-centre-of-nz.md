Had plans to got to Abel Tasman today but spent all day in Nelson. Somehow the day just flew by. Mainly me faffing about trying to use wifi to upload blogs. Well I have been very slack recently.

3 hours later wandered around town which was pretty bland although the Currywurst & Kranksy were delicious. Who would have thought you could buy good German sausage in NZ?

Our daily exercise consisted of a short hike up a hill to the centre of NZ.

Parked up in Nelson I-Site carpark for the night. The first official place we‚Äôd found in a town for ‚Äúfree‚Äù camping. Not the most exotic place we‚Äôve stayed but it allowed us to pop to the cinema across the road, have popcorn thrown at us by the ticket guy there, realise it was salted when I was craving sweet and watch a fab film called Source Code. You can tell why Matt wanted to watch it. And Jake Gyllenhaal helped persuade me üòâ.
