The final day of an amazing journey. Hop skipping and jumping back from the dream to reality. 

I’ll keep it short & sweet as I am writing in retrospect. Part of me doesn’t want to finish this because it’s acceptance that it’s over. But it has to be. And we have moved on and are back doing normal everyday things.&nbsp; And this will surely irritate anyone who reads this now because it is such a cliché but it is true. We are not back to the way we were. We can’t be because we of the experiences we have had and shared. And every day we try to remember something from our journey. And sometimes just out of nowhere it will randomly hit us that “we did it”! We bloody well lived out our dream. And we smile at each other and think no-one can ever take that away from us. 

So here, in photos, are our last bits of that journey that saw us leave London Heathrow on September 14th 2010, travel by plane, train, tuk-tuk, bus, camel, boat, jeep, foot, metro, taxi, moped, longtail, bicycle, slow-boat, over-crammed mini-bus, yacht, campervan, greyhound coach and electric bike across India, South East Asia, New Zealand, Australia & Japan and home again home again on 29th July 2011.
