Dragged Matt out of bed early so we could make it to the bus station for the 9am bus to Thaton. For some reason everyone we met knew we were heading to Thaton – the tuk tuk driver, the guys at the bus station. Perhaps it’s the only bus that “farang”&nbsp; (foreigners) get from the Chang Pheuak bus station in Chiang Rai. 

This was our first ordinary bus journey. A bus with 2 seats one side, 3 seats the other side (similar to before) but with fans and windows that open instead of aircon. And it was perfectly fine. A 3 hour 45min journey broken up by a 10min stop in Van at 10:30 and a 2min coffee break for the driver in Fang. The bus was clean and sparkling. It felt like a retro American diner with turquoise seats, metal trims and metal ceiling. No dodgy pattern seats in sight.

Thaton is close to the Myanmar border and was the quietest place we have been to in Thailand. Hardly any tourists or inhabitants for that matter. A few restaurants and guest houses alongside the river. We found the cheapest accommodation we’ve stayed in in Thailand. Naam Waan (or Nam Whan, depending on which sign you look at – why is everything spelled differently?!) guesthouse, for 200THB. Run by a shy couple, it was a terrace of small chalets in their back garden. And the first cold shower for a long time. Not lukewarm like many places. Absolutely freezing! As Thaton is further north again when the sun disappears so does the heat so we’ve been feeling cold quite a bit recently.&nbsp; Can’t complain at that price though. 

We did see lots of visitors at the Wat Thaton, however. A temple at the top of&nbsp; a 3km winding road with 8 other levels of temples and statues for viewing on the way up. As we puffed up the hill, sorng thaew passing us now and then with people shouting hello and waving, we could see the burning red sun setting beyond the trees and just made it to the top of the temple as the the sun went behind the clouds. It didn’t matter really. The temple was impressive itself. A relatively new circular building with a winding slope up through the centre decorated with dragon scales which ended at a shrine at the top guarded by a silver and gold dragon. A balcony around the outside gave fantastic 360 degree views across Thaton and further to the hills of Chiang Rai and to Myanmar on the opposite side.
