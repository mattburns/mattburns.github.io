Not satisfied with our adrenaline-filled Sunday we went on the Shotover Jet today. A 30min jet-powered speedboat ride through shallow water, down narrow canyons and 360Â° spins. Pretty exciting but not as good as the bungy. Weâ€™re thinking we should have done them the other way around.

Walked, & climbed in part, up to top of hill (Ben Lomond national park) behind Queenstown to see more stunning views.

Took the Gondola back down the hill and reluctantly left Queenstown to drive to a campsite north of Te Anau halfway to Milford Sound.

It was dark when we arrived and we drove probably 1km through a country lane covered in trees to a parking area with no-one else here. We can hear water running somewhere. Another surprise awaits us in the morning ðŸ˜€
