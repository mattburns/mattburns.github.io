Yesterday went for a gorgeous romantic meal at Ambrai restaurant overlooking Lake Pichola, Lake Palace Hotel on Jagniwas Island and City Palace. Beautiful setting. Lush food. Worth every penny. We normally spend around 300 rupees on a meal. That was 1000. Which works out about the same as a Dominos pizza!
  
Watched Octopussy in a lovely bar lazing on cushions on the floor. We recognised so much of the scenery. it was fun to do it.

Masala chai with the lads from the hotel – Shiva, Ganesh and Govyran (i think) who are 21, 18 and 17 respectively and look all about 12. After trying to ask how to say a few words in Hindi we ended up learning that tea is chai about 20 times!! :)

Today cooking lesson with Shakti Singh, one of the brothers who own Pratap Bhawan Guest House. We were lucky to get a personal lesson as we were the only 2 students. Normally there are between 6 and 12. Matt became a dab-hand at stirring curry paste and flipping chapati. He’s going to be doing all the cooking when we get back to England :)
  
Shakti is apparently a bit of a celebrity around these ere parts. He had Jamie Oliver’s assistant attend one of his classes and then buy saffron for the great chef himself.
  
There are newspaper clippings on the wall about his businesses. I loved the bit about somebody saying he was like England’s Delia Smith. So for a long time he told everyone he was Delia Smith. Until one lady pointed out that Delia is in fact a woman so he felt embaressed. Then another person said you’re like Jamie Oliver and Shakti had to check – is Jamie a he or she?
  
The cooking class only lasted 90 mins but we got a good insight into traditional indian cooking and have some lush recipes to try back home including masala chai which is delicious. We also ate everything we cooked and more so feeling extremely bleugh now – who said we would lose weight in india? i feel stuffed to the brim most days!

We have had our first experience of an indian laundry. our clothes have come back clean, ironed and folded and how they ever knew that they were our clothes as soon as we arrived i’ll never know. they don’t give tickets or take names or any kind of reference. it just gets bundled up into one pile when you leave it there and comes back in a neat pile the next day. miracle. 10 items cost 120 rupees (about £1.70)

We move on again tomorrow to Mt Abu in the west. And again it will be a shame to leave. We have met some lovely people and the place is beautiful. perhaps too many rickshaws and motorbikes running you over as they try to overtake through a 4 inch gap on a corner and bloody expensive loo paper but otherwise a magical place that i could come back to one day (especially to stay in one of the top-end hotels!)
