Never get the train from Bangkok to Aranya Prathet (border).

2 hours on a hard upright seat from Bangkok to Ayuthaya at lunchtime is fine. It’s doable.

6 hours plus half hour delay starting at 6am when you’re knackered because you didn’t sleep properly the night before is uncomfortable to say the least. 

The train was relatively empty when we left Hualamphong station. We had a 3-seater for the two of us so nodding off was not a problem. By halfway 4 of us were sat on the same seat. 

The tuk-tuk driver from the station unsurprisingly dropped us off at the “immigration office” on the Thai side where they want you to fill in Cambodian visa forms and hand over fees. I’d read about this place just the day before (the white building on the right as you approach the border) and we left immediately. We already had our online visas and they were trying to get us to fill in paperwork anyway. I also told another couple who promptly left. There is no need to do anything on the Thai side of the border for Cambodia. If you don’t have a visa you get it on the Cambodian side. It is a con.

The journey across the border took longer than anticipated. For some reason checking out of Thailand took longer than checking in. The Cambodian side wasn’t too bad though. A half hour wait I’d say in a tiny room. 

Then the fun began. A guy got us onto a free shuttle to the bus station. Except it wasn’t a bus station of the sort most people know. It was a building that looked like it had different bus companies selling tickets but as soon as you tried to ask them about tickets to Siem Reap they said ask the guy over there. I.e. the guy who was trying to get us on a minibus to Siem Reap because the “government bus” wasn’t due for another 90mins. 

We weren’t having any of it until some other travellers asked us if we’d join them so they’d have a full minibus. Once the bus was full they could head off. OK we agreed to get going as we didn’t know really how long we’d be waiting for.

They told us it would take 2hrs 20 – quicker than the 3hr government bus. It took us over 3hours. Because we stopped at a restaurant about 50km away from Siem Reap. One couple ordered food. It was pointless and expensive. I was not happy. I was knackered from travelling for so long and knowing that Siem Reap was only around the corner frustrated me even more. Why do these companies do this to tourists? Piss them off on purpose? Why not charge a bit extra and get us there quicker? Pathetic.

I was so glad we knew what we were doing once we got to Siem Reap. We had no need for their hotel that they dropped us off at and left as soon as possible to get to our lovely familiar Palm Garden Lodge.

Back in Siem Reap at last. Looking forward to it.
