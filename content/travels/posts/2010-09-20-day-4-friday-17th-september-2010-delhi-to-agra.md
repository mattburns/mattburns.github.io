Now in Agra after an epic journey. An hour in a tuk-tuk dodging traffic in Delhi, a manic New Delhi train station which was heaving with people who were sat/sprawled anywhere they could to shade out of the scorcher of a day.

We boarded the train at 13:35 – half an hour before it was scheduled to depart. Sat on a bottom bunk sleeper seat for a scheduled 3hr journey and arrived in Agra at 18:40 with 2 bags of a crisps as sustinence! (we’re loving the crisps here and india time!) I count 5 hours on the train. Sunday’s train is a 6hr 30min journey so who knows when we’ll get to Ajmer!

About 500m outside of Agra people start getting up to leave so we join them. The main doors are wide open and men and women are jumping from the train narrowly missing bridges and bollards. We guess they must live near by.The train sits outside Agra for another 15mins and guys loiter on the train tracks whilst a uniformed guy with a rifle walks up and down the side of the train. the train horn goes and we start moving as the guys jump back onto the train.we stand by the door watching Agra come into view as the sun sets a deep red. No sign of Taj Mahal yet.

Picked up from the station by some poor guy who’d been waiting an hour and a half for us to arrive in his cute little tuk-tuk and Agra seems so much nicer than Delhi already. Less traffic,less people, less beeping.And the Tourists Rest House where we are staying has a lovely feel of holiday. We ate dinner in the courtyard (vegetarian curry and banana lassis yum) with candles and fairy lights. the candles are helpful for the powercuts – there has been 3 so far and it’s only 21:90!

6am start tomorrow to see the sunrise over Taj Mahal :)
