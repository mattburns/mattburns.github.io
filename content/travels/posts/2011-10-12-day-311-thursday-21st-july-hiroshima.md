Guess what? It’s our penultimate Thursday.

We took the Shinkansen to Hiroshima. Otherwise known as the bullet train, it lives up to its reputation. It was on time and it was zippy. If you try to walk whilst it’s moving you feel like you’re floating and have no control over your core balance. It has a similar feel to a plane. Except with miles more legroom and much better food. We happened to miss the snack lady as she passed so I went up to purchase something from her and she waved me back to my seat. She promptly returned to us and gave us our order of coffee & neatly packaged, uniform sized finger sandwiches with the crusts cut-off together with those wet hand towels for freshening up. Maybe this is what first class is like on British Airways.

This wasn’t our train – it was the fastest most expensive Nozomi, not covered by the Japan Rail Pass.[![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/10/P10802601.jpg)][1]

This on the other hand was our train and is covered by the Japan Rail Pass – the Hikari Rail Star.[![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/10/P10802621.jpg)][2]

Outside ,the world of Japan whizzed by silently. Between the track and the sea, towns of high-rise flats and grey office blocks, green hills & temples, houses with that eastern style roofing with ornate edging.

After just 5 hours and one change of train at Shin-Osaka we arrived in Hiroshima, over 500 miles away from Tokyo.

After being crammed into a tram which pottered through the centre of Hiroshima at a 1000th of the pace of the Shinkansen we finally arrived at the traditional Ryoku we hoped to stay at. No-one answered. It was hot & humid & after a long journey we craved a shower. We gave them 10 more minutes and still no answer so had to go for Plan B. J Hoppers hostel. Luckily just around the corner and luckily they had a double room in Japanese style. So we almost got what we were hoping for.

We took a wander to get our bearings and found a great little bakery which provided us with good snackettes to eat whilst soaking up some sun in the nearest park. The park happened to be the peace memorial park. The main area impacted by the A-bomb dropped at the end of the Second World War. It is a moving place. Lots of green space as you would imagine from a park with different memorials dotted about.

It is surrounded by water and when we walked to the other side we saw the infamous building that was at the epicentre [*_[cough][6]* – Ed_] of the bomb. The A-bomb dome building (originally known as the Hiroshima Prefectural Commercial Exhibition Hall). I’ve seen photographs and pictures of that building many times but seeing it in reality is indescribable. I couldn’t believe we were standing looking at it.

The girl in the monument, Sadako, believed that if she made 1,000 paper cranes she would cure her leukaemia. She died before she had finished so children all over the world, inspired by her story, build cranes and send them to the memorial in many different forms. It is very moving to see.

Peace memorial with the names of the all of the victims inside.[![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/10/P1080276_thumb1.jpg)][13]

In the evening after a roof-top beer went on the hunt for the famous Hiroshima speciality dish [Okonomiyaki][14]. You sit in front of a giant hot plate watching the chefs fry up batter with bacon and cabbage, served over noodles and smothered in a gooey sauce served in what looks like a deep-pan pizza tray with a trowel. Sounds like a leftover fry-up, looks like a left-over fry-up, tastes like a left-over fry-up. Delicious.

_Footnote: Japan Rail Pass information_

_For those of you thinking about going to Japan and wondering about the trains, do it. You MUST apply for a Japan Rail Pass before entering the country as it is only available to non-Japanese visitors or Japanese non-residents. You receive an exchange note which you take to one of the main train stations to, unsurprisingly, exchange for a rail pass. This comes as a folded piece of card with your name and reference. It isn’t very technically advanced and if you lose it you’re stuffed. You cannot get a replacement._

_There are lots of companies that can order this for you. I believe STA Travel do it. But as we were strapped for time we used an online agency called [Japanese Experience][16] based in Paris who were excellent and sent it to our hotel in Tokyo. It cost ¥28000 for one ticket plus £17 delivery charge. This may sound like a lot. It isn’t. A single journey from Tokyo to Hiroshima costs something like ¥18000._

_We exchanged our note for the Japan Rail Pass at Ueno station. It took about 10 mins as you need to complete a form and wait for them to issue the pass._
