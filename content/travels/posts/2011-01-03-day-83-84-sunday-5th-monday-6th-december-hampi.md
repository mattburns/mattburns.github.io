Left Goa at 7.30am and arrived Hospet at 3ish. Somehow it is easy for us now to sit on a train for over 7hrs. 

We were in Sleeper class for the first time and we prefer it to 3A/C. Can’t say what it would be like overnight but during the day it was nice to be able to see the outside world passing by. There are windows and shutters but both can be opened as you like to let in air. OK there are no mod-cons like power plugs but there are plenty of fans and it feels more open and easier to breathe in than the cooped up aircon carriages.

As we arrived in Hospet a guy started loitering around us in the train. We thought he was going to clean the train or something but turns out he was a tuk-tuk driver touting for business to Hampi. He must have boarded the train as soon as it started coming into the station. Of course with our usual attitudes of refusing those who harass us we shunned him and headed for another random tuk-tuk who happened to have the slowest vehicle in the country. We were overtaken by everything, goats included I’m sure. Plus the original tuk-tuk salesman who shook his head at us as he flew past.

Hampi was incredible. Not to make it sound childish but it felt like driving into an episode of the Flintstones. The landscape was so different to anything else we’d seen. Huge bulbous rocks balanced on top of one another as though they’d just been placed there by hand and were about to topple off any minute.

In amongst these rocks was Hampi town, one long street of traders trying to flog you the usual tat, leading up to a fantastic Hindu temple. The temple had it’s own cow loitering around the altar and as people lit candles, and kissed the altar, they also patted the cow.

In an attempt to find a high point to see the sunset from, we wandered in a random direction and ended up luckily at one of the seven sunset points. Surrounded by remains of old temples – rectangular rocks balanced on more rectangular rocks – and surrounded by these magnificent boulders, we sat and watched the sun go down in the distance and the sky turn pink. Pretty magical.

Monday we planned to wander along the river bank to the main Vitthala temple but instead hired a moped and drove out to the temple instead. It was amazing. Lots of various carvings in the stone pillars. The place was practically deserted though. Strange for a World Heritage site.

Back on the moped went to more temples and ruins at the Royal Enclosure and Hazararama Temple.

The Lotus Mahal and the Elephant stables were favourites of ours. Although how an elephant could have been comfortable in one of those rooms is beyond us.

Matt asked for a photo of a group of girls who kindly obliged and we must send them a copy:

Later wandered to the end of Hampi Bazaar past makeshift homes within the old temple ruins to the gorilla shrine which ironically was covered in macaques. There were signs everywhere saying do not desecrate the ruins and at the end was the police station built inside the ruins with potted plants in the front garden. Very quaint.

I finally got my Indian Head Massage. It looked like a professional outfit from the signs outside. Inside I was pretty much sat in someone’s front room. TV in one corner with the son eating his thali and a massage table along the wall with a curtain divider and the kitchen next door. As I was just having a head massage I got to sit in one of those world-wide popular garden plastic chairs.

Apart from being able to hear the tv, which went off after 10 mins due to a powercut (there is a god!), it was a good experience. The woman used coconut oil which I love and she was a lot rougher than I am when I do IHM. It was more invigorating than relaxing but definitely felt good. At one point it felt as though she was pulling my hair out of my scalp. And twisting the back of my neck my spine might snap. But I came out alive the other end and smiling and it didn’t matter it was in her front room. It was all part of the experience and normal for India. And when I gave her the money (about £3) she blessed it and had a very genuine smile. 

Hampi is a fascinating place. But unless you’re climbing or doing yoga for a while there is not much else there (apart from ruins). The temples and landscape have the wow factor but if you’re looking for somewhere to chill for a few days I think Pushkar wins in that respect.

Ah yes we went back to Margao on a sleeper bus. Well we couldn’t believe our luck. It must have been brand new. It was a coach with 2 storeys of sleeping compartments, singles on one side and doubles on the other. We had a double with a sliding door to shut ourselves in and it plenty of room to lie down or sit up. We thought we’d get a great night’s sleep and wake up refreshed in Margao….
