Before I forget mum has received the parcel from Darjeeling and it’s in one piece! She thought it looked like drugs as it’s all wrapped in white muslin. It only took 3 weeks so that’s pretty good. I think it has beaten most of the postcards which seem to have been lost in the post.

&nbsp;

Tuesday morning joined the hardened commuters on the 5:50 train from Kochi and by 10:00 we were at Mummy Bamboo House in Varkala about a minute’s walk from the North Cliff edge overlooking the Indian Ocean. 

Rani at Mummy Bamboo House is lovely. Straightaway she was making us tea and later that day a traditional Keralan lunch of fish curry, rice and three different types of spiced vegetables all freshly cooked by Rani and served in a thali tin. We met “Mummy”, a writer, who lives up the road and has been coming to Rani’s for lunch for the past 4 years. She came to India with her daughter 6 years ago and decided to set up home here. 

![IMG_6423](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_6423.jpg)We also met Rani’s baby boy being fed by grandma & her 11-year old son. The son seemed extremely resourceful. Mummy wanted a new rolling pin for her chapati so off he went with his dad’s knife to cut some bamboo. And kept cutting it and kept cutting it to make it flat until he cut it too much he had to start again, this time with the saw! He did it in the end. Can you imagine an 11-year old in the UK being given a big knife and saw and make a rolling pin? Amazing. ![Lad chopping a piece of bamboo to make a rolling pin](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_6435.jpg)![IMG_6424](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_6424.jpg)&nbsp; 

Varkala is a strip of shops, restaurants and ayurvedic massage centres along a cliff top with 3 beaches. It is the most touristy western place we have visited. Everyone is trying to sell you something. It’s a mixture of good points and bad points as all of India seems to be. The good being great food, good accommodation, western loos everywhere! The coastline is beautiful. Beaches and black rocks and palm trees. Eagles flying overhead on the thermals. (And parasailers too). The bad being the hassle and the lack of real India (which makes it more expensive). It’s crazy that we get frustrated by The Real India but being here is such a fake India that we miss The Real India. Although Varkala isn’t fully developed yet. There are still hints of the rest of India. Such as the rubbish strewn down the cliff side. The staring, but that’s mainly the blokes on the beach and they are constantly shooed away by the beach police. 

There seems to be a rule on Papanasham Beach. No non-westerners. We saw a few Indian guys who were just about to go swimming being whistled at by the police and told to leave. I’m not comfortable with that. There is an issue here that needs to be resolved and to me they’re treating the symptoms not the cause. Why do groups of Indian guys feel it necessary to gawk at bikini-clad women? Well why do any men? It happens all over the world. But perhaps not so obviously. But it’s less subtle here because they’re not used to seeing half naked women. It’s taboo. So why let westerners come here and sunbathe half-naked? Because they bring money to the area. It’s another example of where things are changing here at different rates. So much of Indian culture is similar to our culture over half a century ago. They haven’t had the changes we had in the 60’s and 70’s but in trying to adopt western culture it clashes with their traditional values. 

I don’t think I’ve really made the point I wanted to here but wanted to write it down as thoughts for the future. India will go through more changes, as we saw in the photography exhibition in Kochi it is happening and it will be interesting to think back to little occurrences like this and if they’ve changed.

Completely changing the subject, we arranged to meet up with Kirsten & Nick for dinner and then bumped into them in a cafe earlier in the day. It was so good to see familiar faces and have a good chinwag. So lucky for us to have been in Kerala at the same time as them. Again a complete coincidence as we had no idea when we would be in this area of India. Had our first cocktails of the trip. It was happy hour at Kerala Coffee House so of course had to oblige. As it was raining it was a good enough excuse to stay and have two. Nick & Kirst were such bad influences :)

I’d bought a new dress for the occasion as a treat (up until now I’d only had shorts and trousers) so brought out the makeup to feel even&nbsp; more girly. It felt strange putting on blusher and mascara after 2 months of being bare. That had been the longest period without makeup since I started slapping it on as a teenager. 

&nbsp;

Wednesday we attempted to go to Black Beach to meet K & N but somehow faffed about so long doing desperately needed washing and who knows what else that we didn’t get anywhere near there til 3pm. By that time K & N were frazzled from a day of sunbathing. When Matt & I finally made it to Black Beach it started to rain just for a change. We persevered and managed to get a few rays before the sun set and went off to meet K & N plus their mate Charlie (who also coincidentally happened to be in Varkala at the same time) for Thai curry & beer. Delicious.
