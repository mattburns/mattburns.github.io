Nice early pickup at 7.15am to get the 8.30am ferry to Ko Phi Phi. The weather was gorgeous and the view of the limestone karsts of Phi Phi appearing in the distance was amazing. Hopped off and hopped onto another ferry to Ko Lanta where a woman was selling ice-creams. Genius idea.

Arrived in Ko Lanta and met off the boat by 2 guys from Fevrier resort who bundled us, another couple and our bags into the back of a pickup truck for the 20min journey to Klong Nin. Ko Lanta is a lot larger than we realised.

Fevrier resort is just across the road from the beach and is mainly wooden bungalows but our room is in a semi-detached concrete bungalow and is very very lush. It is clean, has a tv, fridge, huge bed with the towels laid out in heart shapes with fresh orchids and a veranda with a little table and chairs made from tree stumps and branches. Plus loads of plug sockets! Something many places lack.

Explored Klong Nin a bit and it’s mainly resorts and restaurants with a few little shops at one end. The beach is gorgeous and has lots of lovely beach bars along it all decorated for christmas. The water is the clearest and warmest we’ve ever been in. It’s bliss. 

**Christmas Eve**

Breakfast at Fevrier was included in the room price so couldn’t say no. Eggs, ham, hotdog and salad. The ham was reformed turkey ham cut into triangles the hotdog was one of those boiled ones with the ends snipped into a cross. 

It’s Christmas Eve so in true last minute style we went and did our christmas shopping for each other. Hired a moped so we could go to the main town and stop off at Long Beach on the way back. It’s another good beach and is much busier but we prefer Hat Klong Nin as the sea is calmer and the beach is wider.

&nbsp; Ate at a BBQ restaurant on the beach called Richeys. This is the chef whom cooked our delicious tiger prawns and ribs.

He also gave us a freebie taster of some shellfish. Not sure what it was:

A guy did a fire show in front of the restaurant and it was pretty impressive until he set fire to himself. Matt continued to take photos as the guy rolled around on the ground and then legged it into the sea to cool off.

Treated ourselves to a glass of red wine. As it’s Christmas :)

And everywhere chinese lanterns were being set free into the sky so we joined in. Ours shot off towards the restaurant at first and I thought we were going to be responsible for setting fire to the roof but it span back towards the sea and skimmed the water before floating up into the black sky and we could see it flying further and further out to sea until it disappeared completely. The lady said it was lucky for it to float up. It was almost a disaster as many others had been but lucky for us it steered itself out of trouble.

**Christmas Day**

Christmas in Thailand, how weird!

We had no tree so the TV table had to suffice. Mine are the red pressies from Matt and Matt’s are the blue pressies from me :)

Fevrier Resort’s Christmas Tree was better

Homemade bucks fizz and ferrero rocher (pressie from Matt) on the veranda. Does life get any better than this?

Christmas day sunbathing.

No turkey dinner for us today. Instead we had multicoloured lollys on the beach followed by fish & chips and a bottle of Chang at a beachbar. 

The evening was spent with the folks at Fevrier Resort. They’d laid on a BBQ & buffet and we didn’t have the heart to go anywhere else. Sat next to a holidaying couple from Germany and Lek kept bringing us more and more food. Plus beer and red wine and some birthday cake made for a pleasant evening.

Spent 40mins trying to get the internet to work and finally got to call mum and skype dad at Jane & Jason’s place and the laptop was passed around everyone including nan & grandad. It was lovely to see everyone on camera after so long.

**Boxing Day**

What better way to spend Boxing day than in deckchairs sipping beer. Mmmm.

Just after this photo was taken a singing Thai ice-cream man came along!
