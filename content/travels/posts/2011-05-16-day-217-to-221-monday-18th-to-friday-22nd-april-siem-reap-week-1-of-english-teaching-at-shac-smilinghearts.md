I have been teaching every day from 9:30 to 11:30 and from 15:30 to 17:30 at the [shac-smilinghearts][1] school set up by Aly which opened on November 1st 2010. I cycle there and back twice a day. It‚Äôs only just over 1km away down mud tracks, past a mixture of large houses and small wooden houses on stilts. Men & boys sit at the side of the polluted streams that run through the village with their fishing rods hoping to catch something. This is about 1km from the fancy tourist centre of Siem Reap.

In Aly‚Äôs backyard there are 3 classrooms and a teacher‚Äôs room with a small library of Khmer & English school books. The rooms are open to the elements as they‚Äôre made of criss-crossed bamboo. When it rains they have plastic sheeting to cover the sides of the rooms.

I‚Äôm teaching grade 2 aged from 7 to 11. They know simple vocab and I need to teach them simple sentences and additional vocab. You never realise how your accent sounds until you have 15 kids repeating a word like toothbrush or fork verbatim back to you. I now say ‚Äútooth‚Äù all proper like.

It‚Äôs hard work. Much harder than in Laos. I have the same kids everyday for a 2 hour class rather than different kids for 1 hour. It‚Äôs a challenge trying to think of lesson plans and homework everyday. On the other hand it‚Äôs so good because I‚Äôm getting to know the kids really well. I am awful at remembering their names but I‚Äôm learning their characters and their learning styles. It‚Äôs also interesting because I aim to teach the same lesson in the afternoon as in the morning because they‚Äôre a different class learning the same vocab. But a lesson that works well in the morning can be a complete disaster in the afternoon and vice versa.

Some of it has to do with the help I get from Nathaly and Christina. They are two of Aly‚Äôs daughters who attend the lessons and help with translation between me and the kids when needed. Nathaly is on the left, Christina on the right.

If they‚Äôre not there it can be funny trying to get the class to understand a concept or game. But it gets me thinking on my feet and sometimes we end up adapting a game for the better.

So games have been a mixture of success & failure. They‚Äôre an essential part of the lesson. If they‚Äôre sitting there too long listening, writing or learning new vocab they‚Äôll start shouting ‚Äúgame game game‚Äù.

Hangman was quite successful. Though the first time we played it they thought they had to guess the word straightaway. And usually did!

Chinese whispers turned into yelling the word from one end of the line to the other.

The memory game was great fun. This is a pretty well-known idea. I had loads of items like a pen, pencil, toothbrush, eraser, book, fork, spoon, etc under a sheet. There were 2 teams and 1 from each team had to look away whilst I removed an item. They then had to look back and I‚Äôd remove the sheet and they had to remember which item was missing. For some reason the afternoon class thought the game was to grab as many items as possible from the table. I had 12 kids scrabbling on the table all at the same time. I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh.

In between lessons I‚Äôve been giving Aly a hand with corresponding with donors. She is constantly working on raising money or getting school supplies or arranging volunteers or organising everything else.

Thursday I stayed at the school all day. Just as the class ended the rains came and I had no bike that day or any waterproofs. The playground quickly filled with water and Aly‚Äôs kids plus a few of the schoolkids that stayed behind enjoyed skidding and splashing about in it. They were caked in mud and laughing their heads off. I wish I could have joined them!

Aly invited me to join her family for lunch. Delicious marinated pepper beef, rice and salad with a Cambodian spicy sauce followed by fresh watermelon. She showed me pictures of the floods last year where her kids were swimming in her backyard. The whole village floods every summer in their area. At least waist deep. 

She‚Äôs also invited me to go to one of the local towns with her on Saturday. Really looking forward to it.

And Matt? Yes he did leave the room at least twice this week üòâ

We got into a routine and I would leave him after breakfast each morning to start coding whilst I went to school and back via the local market to get bread and supplies for lunch. I‚Äôd arrive back after 3 hours and he wouldn‚Äôt have moved. I‚Äôd help out with anything I could with [SCF][4] and we‚Äôd have a random sarnie whilst listening to half an Adam & Joe podcast before I left him in peace again for school.

We had one or two nights out including one where I managed to have another tree frog take a liking to me. It landed on the table next to me and when Matt poked his camera in its face it used me as a springboard to escape back to the more familiar surroundings of the leafy plant behind me.

Teaching is exhausting work so many evenings we just stayed in and chilled. I don‚Äôt know how full-time teachers do it every day. No wonder you need such long school holidays! 

It‚Äôs so rewarding though and good fun.
