Arrived in Sukhothai after a 5.5 hour bus journey. This time 1st class so normal sized seats but included a free lunch stop at a service station. You could choose what you wanted from an array of dishes and Matt & I both chose at random as we had no idea what anything was. The server said “Spicy” in a way that we shouldn’t want it but yes of course we want it. We’ll try anything once. Still no idea after eating it what any of it was but the flavours and tingly spices were spot on.

Hopped on a sorng taaow to The Garden House, the cheapest place we’ve stayed in Thailand so far. It’s a lovely little place with cosy bamboo bungalows with decent flooring (no gaps this time), free wifi and cheap beer. Our only real gripe wasn’t with the accommodation but with early morning risers of Sukhothai. At 7am on Monday morning we were awoken by some woman nattering in Thai through a loudspeaker. At 8am, admittedly we should have been getting up by then, someone decided to mow the lawn next door with a contraption that sounded like a didgeredoo. More original alarm clock than cockerels crowing I guess.

Before visiting the main historical park we headed to Wat Thawet Learning Garden 8km away on a tuk-tuk where the seats are at the front and the driver is at the back. The sun hadn’t appeared yet so it was a bit chilly and felt strange to be cold after so long in the heat. Although it was still probably a heatwave compared to UK weather.

Wat Thawet is the realisation of a Buddhist’s monk’s dream. It’s not well maintained so is a little overgrown and damaged in places but that added to the creepiness to the place. We were the only visitors. The grounds were filled with different characters and animals and a 20ft Buddha. Some were brightly painted ala Mary Rose Young. Others were grey and dull as they were the grim tormented souls. Matt’s photos will explain more:

Back in New Sukhothai we found the bus to the old city. I say a bus. It was a toyota truck or van with most of the body cut away and what seemed like an old boat structure at the back. A large sorng taaow. Long benches down either side. And glass-less windows. Maximum speed 20mph.

At the park we hired bikes again and the sun had come out in all it’s glory so we dodged from shade to temple to shade. 

Sukhothai was the original capital of Siam after the Khmer empire and before Ayutthaya. It is different to Ayutthaya in that the main temples are in a beautiful landscaped park with lotus ponds. It was very serene. We did have a&nbsp; bit of a shock though when we saw a rail of tied plastic bags containing water and an array of creatures – turtle, snake, fish, toad – all in the same bag. I want to believe they were just being stored whilst the water was cleaned but they were probably destined for gloomier futures.

We ate in the local market. A couple of sausages on sticks which turned out to contain rice and meat. When going back to the same stall for more an “affray” broke out between a woman on another stall and a guy. I just happened to see as the woman walked towards me, the guy picked up a plastic stool and threw it at her. Then started trying to attack her. The lady on the sausage stall stood between them and we were unsure what to do. The guy just shouted in Thai and then leaped at them both so I started shouting at him but he completely ignored me. Matt was ready to step in and everyone else just stood and watched. The guy left for 2 mins and came back with a bike with a baby on the front. He proceeded to try to attack the woman once more and in the process almost dropped his baby who was caught by a young girl. Matt started towards him and he rode off on his bike with baby.

It was such a difficult situation. We had no idea what was going on because we can’t understand Thai yet we couldn’t stand and watch. Regardless of what this woman had done, the guy was out-of-order attacking her and we were in the middle of it when it happened. The poor sausage woman was shaking afterwards and was grateful to Matt for helping. He also got a cheer from another stallholder as we walked through the market!

That wasn’t our only experience of the day with a creepy guy. 12:30am, fast asleep in our hut, we woke up to find someone bumbling about on our balcony and then trying to open the door. He was a drunk Frenchman who had forgotten which room he was in but didn’t seem to understand that our room wasn’t his room. So kept coming back until I shouted at him to go away and probably woke the whole resort! Matt had wanted to do the sensible thing and go and talk to the guy but me having an over-active imagination thought he’d be an axe-murderer so I wouldn’t let him go. I ended up sleeping fully-clothed incase the madman came back and managed to break his way in!
