We can’t believe how much water we use and how much waste we make. This is an eye-opener. We have no more water again and we need to empty everything. Our tank holds 91 litres and apparently the shower uses 10 litres a minute. Can’t quite believe it.

Shared the driving today. A little scary at first on the winding roads after 8 months of no driving but it was like riding a bike and I soon got back into it. It meant Matt could see more of the scenery. And what scenery. We headed 70km along the same road back to Hanmer Springs and the sun was out at last, the skies were blue, grey and white, there were rainbows here and there and the colours of the trees, fields, rocks, rivers were an overload for the eyes.

Hanmer Springs is a quaint little Alpine town with beech tree lined avenues all in oranges, auburns, reds and golds. Beautiful. With a backdrop of mountains and fields full of beefy cows and sheep. The air is so fresh. You feel instantly healthy.

Even healthier after spending 2 hours in Hanmer Springs thermal pools.

Now, after Matt’s first experience of emptying the “black water ” was luckily more successful than my attempt at filling the water tank and his first try at emptying the grey water, we’re in a campsite on the edge of town surrounded by woodland called Alpine park with our Monteith’s 6 pack of Golden Lager (there goes the detox), brewed in Greymouth on the West Coast. Reminds us of Granville Island beer.

The whole place reminds us of Canada.
