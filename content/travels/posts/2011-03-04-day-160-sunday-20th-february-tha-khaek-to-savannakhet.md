Our bus journey from Tha Khaek was quite an interesting one. They played an array of cheesy music videos. Some young kids prancing around. And one old guy. Well say in his late 50s, singing four or five different songs that all sounded the same and for each video he was wearing a shirt and tie and was either stood at the side of a main road with the limestone cliffs in the background or in a field dancing like your dad. He also had four backing dancers – two girls and two guys in traditional dress – doing traditional Lao dancing. They played this twice and we kept hearing the same tune in the local village. Our guide said he was popular right now.

Saw the first eggs on sticks being sold in one of the towns on the way to Savannakhet. We’d seen fish and chicken legs but this was a new one.

Yes proof of eggs on sticks![eggs on sticks - through the bus window](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1050143.jpg)
