Congratulations to Helen & Martyn on the birth of their daughter Alys Kate on 13th. 

4 months travelling. It feels like we have done so much but nothing at the same time and we’re already a third of the way through. :(

13th – Moved down-market today to MD House in the old city. Partly because we couldn’t justify paying for Butterfly anymore and partly because we wanted to see a bit more of Chiang Mai instead of lazing around by the pool.

Funnily enough MD House also has a pool. Which someone on tripadvisor had kindly pointed out is shaped like a male appendage. We don’t think it was intentional but I couldn’t see it as any other shape after reading that!

14th – After wandering around Chiang Mai old city for a few hours and seeing more temples with inspiring notices amongst the trees plus a monks school with kids playing tug of war in the playground we decided to pamper ourselves.

At last our feet were just about damage free at the same time (after my canoe accident and matt’s climbing shoes mashing his so tried out fish spa where you dangle your feet in a fishtank and little fish nibble at your skin. It’s meant to get rid of dead skin and revitalise and soften your feet. Matt had about 5 times as many fish in his tank than I did so whilst I found it quite pleasant and gentle most of the time he felt like he was being attacked at first. Although once the fish were filling up and/or his feet were numb he didn’t mind it so much. I on the other hand had a mossie bite they managed to attack and that became quite painful. Like little needles sticking in you. We only stayed in for 15mins so it didn’t make our feet baby fresh but they were definitely a little softer and I wouldn’t say no to having it done again.

Tried Burmese food for dinner tonight. Something new. In a restaurant that sounded more like an English pub than Burmese. We chose our dishes and then realised we were having what was pictured on the menu. Very Derren Brown. So we only had to point at the photos like true tourists. Was delicious too.

I always think I’m not a fan of boxing but when I happen to see one on TV I can get into it which is what happened with the Muay Thai boxing match we went to Friday night. “Kalare Boxing Stadium” was an outdoor ring setup on a scrap bit of land behind the night market with rows of plastic patio chairs filled with tourists drinking cans of Chang.

![P1040407-1](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/01/P10404071.jpg) 

The first match was between a 12-year old and a 13-year old. They looked so young and I wasn’t sure about staying to watch but turns out they can be more vicious than the older guys. The commentator said they do 2-3 hours of training everyday after school and only after at least 6 months do they start fighting in matches. 

![IMG_1156](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_1156.jpg)

All the fighters do a ritual before they fight, rocking on their legs in the centre of the ring and moving their arms around then kissing each corner of the ring.

![IMG_1345](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_1345.jpg)

![IMG_1361](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_1361.jpg)&nbsp;&nbsp; 

The next match were 18 year olds (not considered professional) and then 60kg and 62kg adult professional fights. It was interesting to see the difference in skills from young to professional. Matt got right up at the ringside (and even on the ringside at one point) to take some incredible action shots whilst I watched from my plastic seat ouching and oohing but still watching. Being the most excited when one knocked the other down [_Haha. Brillliant. –Ed_].

Seeing the skills of the previous guys made for a disappointing “international” match between an English guy and Thai guy which seemed to have been advertised as the main event. All the boxers had sixpacks because of the amount of training they do except this last Thai guy who was slightly chubby. It was embarrassing to watch. We wondered if they’d just asked two guys on the street to fight. I guess you have to start somewhere.

As I said there were a lot of tourists there and everywhere you walk in Chiang Mai you see posters or are handed flyers for the next fight. So I wonder if the business of Muay Thai Boxing is kept alive by actually being an age-old Thai tradition or just by tourists who believe they’re seeing an age-old tradition.

15th – We wanted to do something adventurous as Chiang Mai is known for it’s outdoor activities such as white water rafting, trekking and zipwires but that all seemed a bit too expensive so we opted for Thai Farm Cooking Class :) I’ve always wanted to learn how to make a Thai curry paste and what better place to learn.

Had a really lovely day. We were picked up and taken to a local market where Max our teacher talked about different sauces and rices. Then on we went 20km north of Chiang Mai to an organic farm with a similar feel to Butterfly. Lots of&nbsp; lily ponds and flowers and large wooden rustic buildings. And we spent the day cooking thai curry, tom yum shrimp soup, pad thai, spring rolls, papaya salad, chicken with basil and mango and sticky rice ( which sounds weird but is absolutely delicious). Mum, you know what I said about not wanting a rice cooker, well I want one now! 

Even Matt enjoyed himself :)

After a hard day of cooking we went back to MD House and had a night in watching The Inbetweeners Season 3 (such genius comedy) whilst eating the rest of the food we’d cooked that afternoon. Yum.
