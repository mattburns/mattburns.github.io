Our bus to Sihanoukville was booked for lunchtime so we thought we’d squeeze in some essential sight-seeing before we left Phnom Penh and visited the Royal Palace & Silver Pagoda first thing Tuesday morning. It took us less than an hour to be unimpressed by it. The Silver Pagoda is famed for its solid silver floor. We expected sparkling, dazzling. We got dull, scratched. Only a small amount was uncovered and “on display”, half of which was held down with masking tape. In definite need of some TLC & Silvo.

The buildings in the grounds are fantastic but we have seen so many temples that it’s difficult to be awestruck anymore. Especially at $6.25 a ticket. (I’ve become some a grouch when it comes to money.)

Sightseeing monkey family. _“Ooh Malcolm look at those delicate carverings”, mum said. Poor Malcolm was too little to see over the clippered hedgerow and could only imagine the wonders she was marvelling at._&nbsp; ![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1050688.jpg)

Fours hour later we were by the seaside in Sihanoukville. We found a smart little motel type place 2 mins walk from the beach and managed to barter him down to $8 a night. Trick is to just start walking away. There are plenty of places to stay there.

Sihanoukville is under a lot of redevelopment. The roads have piles of rubble, the pavements are half finished and there a number of large hotels under construction. But once you get to the beach its a different story. It is full of ramshackle beach bar restaurants. As far as the eye can see the beach is lined with tables and chairs, sunloungers and sun umbrellas. All the bars offering standard “Western” food (don’t get me started on this topic) and happy hour beers. Rather like Phuket but less busy and somehow a better atmosphere.

Cambodia is ridiculously cheap for beer. If you’re paying $1 for a glass of draught you’re paying too much. 75cents or 50cents is normal. We were given a flyer for a place called Utopia who have a happy hour with 25cents beer. Stupidly cheap.
