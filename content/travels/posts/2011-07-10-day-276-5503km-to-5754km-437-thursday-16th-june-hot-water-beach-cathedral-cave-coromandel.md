Our morning consisted of digging a hole in the sand and sitting in a shallow pool of water trying to keep it at a pleasant temperature which seemed near impossible as cold water shot out of one area and scolding hot water came out of another. 

We were at Hot Water Beach.

The afternoon consisted of a 30min stomp along the coastline to catch the last of the sun on 2 secluded beaches divided by Cathedral Cove.

As the sun set we made the decision to head to Coromandel to gain some distance. In the process we managed to miss the views from the top of the peninsula completely. But hey-ho it’s just the sea and we’ve seen plenty of it.
