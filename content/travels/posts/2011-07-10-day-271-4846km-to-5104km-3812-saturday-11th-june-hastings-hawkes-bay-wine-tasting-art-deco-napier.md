The sun is out again. And it’s actually quite mild.

Didn’t sleep too well as spooked out by being in a campsite in the middle of nowhere surrounded by loud rustling trees and, so it turns out, fields of sheep.

Hawkes Bay is another famous wine region in NZ. Spent an hour in Hastings. It has a train track running through the centre of a fountain.

Wine-tasted at one cellar door called Black Barn near Havelock North. Succumbed to buying a bottle of Chardonnay, the region’s most famous grape.

Afternoon in Napier (and 5000km mark!). Art Deco buildings everywhere although not as impressive as we imagined. The seafront is lovely. A long stretch of beach with walkways and calm seas. 

Good pebbles for skimming.

Another familiar sight in more ways than one but not for the right bank?

Finally sorted out our remaining set of flights. We’ve brought the homeward bound date forward to 29th July as money isn’t lasting as well here as it did in Asia. So only 7 weeks left of our big trip.

At another DOC campsite near another lake. Looks a pretty cool location. Doesn’t feel as isolated as yesterday’s. As usual dark when arrived so will have to wait and see when the sun is up. Matt tried some fun light-painting though before dinner.
