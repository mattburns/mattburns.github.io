We are on a roll. We caught the rush hour bus to town, managed to get the one that didn’t go near the station which led to us leaping from the bus at Hyde Park at 9am, legging it to Central Station, buying tickets in a flash (there was absolutely zero queue – what is that all about in the main station of a huge city?), skipping through the barriers and onto the top floor of the double-decker parked on platform 6 with 1 min to spare for the 9:09 to Katoomba.

My heart was racing. How we made it without being run over/falling over/stampeding the slow people on the station stairs because the escalator was shut I’ll never know. True Burns style.

All the trains appear to be double-deckers. Lovely steel things with lush green faux-leather seats and big windows for good viewing (better & darn sight cheaper than that bloody Fraser Explorer bus – did I mention I wasn’t impressed by that little expedition?)

And did I also mention the seats are two-way? Yes as a customer & traveller on an Aussie train you have the CHOICE of which way to face and whether you want to sit in a 4 or a 2. Amazing.

After a pleasant 2.5hr journey and locating our very sweet homely hostel “[No. 14][3]” in Katoomba we headed out on our afternoon adventure to see the Blue Mountains. 1km in and we found ourselves in the lovely Leura, an avenue of wooden buildings housing shops of all delights from interior furnishings to chocolate to Christmas decorations. We were marvin by then and stopped for lunch to refuel before the proper walking commenced.

Our route took us down a steep narrow muddy track to the Leura Cascades and we followed the Prince Henry Cliff walkway along the edge of the cliff with some spectacular views across the blue mountains.

Can you spot me?

We reached the Three Sisters just as it began to rain which caused a rainbow to sprout over the famous rocks. There are a few different viewpoints of the Three Sisters on rocks jutting out over the valley.

After a quick scoot around the obligatory tourist shopping centre and hugging a giant koala (as you do)…

…we made our way to the [Skyway][12] at Scenic World as the sky cleared enough for the last rays of sun to hit the Three Sisters and have our own personal trip back across the valley.

It was a long old hilly walk back to the hostel but after filling up on meat pie & lamingtons* from the bakery we managed the last part happily content and it was lovely to get back to the cosy lounge with gas fire & hot cuppa before retiring to our even cosier room in the eaves with floral bed covers and wicker furniture.

&nbsp;

_* We first tried lamingintons/lemmingtons whatever they’re called, soft sponge covered in chocolate and desiccated coconut. Another addition commenced and will be trying the recipe as soon as poss when back home._
