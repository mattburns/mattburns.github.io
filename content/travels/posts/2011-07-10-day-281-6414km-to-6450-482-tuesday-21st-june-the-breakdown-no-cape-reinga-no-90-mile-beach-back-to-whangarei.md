Not a breakdown of the mental kind (just yet) but the mechanical kind. The clutch to be accurate.

We had been indecisive yesterday about whether to drive the 110k to Cape Reinga and back. Did we have time to fit it in? It would be a 4 hour round trip up and back down the peninsula and we wanted to get to Auckland on Wednesday with time to spare to see the city.

After a wander on the beach (we found it) this morning we set off from the campsite and decided YES we would! Weâ€™d come all this way and to not go to the tip of New Zealand where the Pacific Ocean meets the Tasman Sea when so many people had recommended it would be such a shame.

What couldnâ€™t have been more than 10km from the bottom of the peninsula, climbing up a hill, the revs roared and we lost power. The clutch gave up completely, sending a acrid burning smell into the air and we rolled to a stop. Bugger.

To cut a long story short, instead of seeing Cape Reinga we ended up back in Whangarei, (the place we thought weâ€™d never see, would see us twice in as many days) via a stop in Kaitai and a 3hour journey across winding NZ terrain in a tow truck. A whistle-stop tour of Northland in 24hours.

Wilderness were really good. They organised a motel for us and the tow guy dropped us off there before taking the van to the garage. He even helped us unpack all of our crap from the van. And theyâ€™re sending a guy up here tomorrow from Auckland with another van for us.

Madness really as we only have 2 days left in NZ. But we love the independence of the van.

The motel is pretty cute. Itâ€™s like a big studio flat with all the facilities of the van and more space. Minus the wheels.

Our stuff is everywhere. Covering every surface and piece of furniture. How we are going to fit back into 2 backpacks and 2 rucksacks we have no idea. I was shocked to see how many brochures and leaflets weâ€™d accumulated.

A wander into Whangarei didnâ€™t inspire us much but it isnâ€™t a bad place.

And the motel sauna is a bonus. Good to get a little bit of pampering. (Weâ€™d wanted to a dip in the spa tub but apparently the previous occupants had left it unusable. Hmmmâ€¦).

Plus we have an excuse to come back to NZ ðŸ˜€
