2 weeks til Xmas!

Singapore is completely different to India. It’s kind of been a bit of a “culture-shock” for us and we’re having to adapt to another way of living again.

It is very American-like with huge roads, sky-scrapers and 7-11s everywhere. And it is so very clean (even the money) and organised. Almost futuristic. People in cars stop for you at zebra crossings. It has a great metro system.

Matt’s in love with the place and wants to move here!

The only downside we have found so far is in the hostel. Our room is next to to the blokes loos so we hear the showers VERY loudly. The lovely wall stencil brightened our day though:

Ventured to Orchard Road via the very interesting Cathay movie museum with the idea of walking to the Botanical Gardens at the end. About 5km in total. We never got anywhere near the gardens. Orchard Road is a shopaholic’s birthday and christmas rolled into one. Mall after mall with Chanel, Prada, Armani, Tiffanys in every one. We got lost trying to cross the road as we had to use a subway that entered one mall and after weaving through a maze of shop levels, including one with Marks & Spencer, we ended up coming out in another mall across the road on the opposite corner to where we wanted to be.

The whole street seemed to be competing to have the loudest xmas music playing & the best OTT xmas decorations. This particular sparkling purple tree was interactive as you could walk inside, put on some 3D specs and marvel at the extra-sparkly silver glitterballs and purple tinsel over head.

It’s quite an expensive city in general. We managed to find some food halls with reasonable priced dishes and then proceeded to a coffee shop where the coffee cost more than lunch.

Close to sunset we went to sit on the harbourside where there is the distinctive Raffles skyline of financial skyscrapers, the singapore flyer (similar to the london eye) and the latest addition – the Marina Bay Sands resort – 3 large buildings with a boat-shape structure linking them at the top holding a 150metre swimming pool plus a cinema, a hotel, a casino and a mall with Jimmy Choo, Manolo Blahnik, food courts and skating rink.

Once the sun set we listened to some free live jazz and popped to Glutton’s Corner, a large hawkers food place where I tasted the (according to LP) famous oyster omelette. It was an experience. I ate it. May not ever order it again.</p> </p> </p>

As part of the New Year celebrations Singapore is releasing 20,000 white balls into the harbourside to create “visual art” bearing wishes of people for the new year. We both wrote ours on a ball. This is Matt’s:
