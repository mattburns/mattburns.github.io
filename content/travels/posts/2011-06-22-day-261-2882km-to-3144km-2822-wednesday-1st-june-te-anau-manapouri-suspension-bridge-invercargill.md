The sun is shining today, the blue skies are back. Darn it. Should we have stayed in Milford Sound? But you looked so miserable yesterday MS!

Still it made for some beautiful lake views in Te Anau and Manapouri.

The route to Invercargill believe it or not included a stop at Clifton suspension bridge. We were back in Bristol. Ah my mistake it was Clifden. But you could hardly tell the difference.

Which came first?

It was a lovely spot for our lunch anyway whilst we thought of home.

Nothing much to be seen between Clifden and Invercargill. Everywhere seems a bit baron. Probably because it’s winter so everyone is hibernating.

Highlight was passing 3000km and buying a roadside dollar swede. What a beauty!
