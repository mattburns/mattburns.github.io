Early start today as we’re off on our 2nd leg to Singapore!

Up at 5.30, had a lovely cold shower and no breakfast. Specifically asked the guys in reception last night about breakfast before 6am and they said no problem. We’d also checked when hot water was available – 5am til 12pm (stupid – why have it only switched on in the morning? Don’t people shower in the evenings?) Matt went to enquire about the water & breakfast and had to practically stand on the guy in reception to wake him up. Yes hot water, no breakfast til 8am. Great. We waited as late as we could to have showers and still it was freezing. What were we paying so much money for?

As a last ditch to try to get something more out of the hotel we thought we’d take the water from the room fridge. But the fridge stank and there were no seals on the bottles. 

As we left the rip-off Hotel Cowie’s the guy had the balls to ask for a tip “for good luck”. Bugger off!!

The route through Mumbai to the airport was mostly beautiful as the sun was rising behind the city skyline as we drove along the coast. There were already lots of runners on the coastal path.

Nearer the airport there were many many makeshift homes along the roadside and under the flyover. People living under pieces of tarpaulin and plastic with all their worldly belongings and babies laying on the ground. Such a contrast from central Mumbai which was very wealthy.

&nbsp;

Talking of wealthy when you go to Mumbai airport you need to take out a loan to buy a coffee. OK so it’s pretty reasonable compared to Heathrow but when a cup of chai normally costs 5 rupees, paying 150 rupees did sting. It was good coffee though :)

Bye Bye India….

…Hello Singapore

Fab fab fab flight to Singapore. It was our first time on a Qantas flight and it felt luxurious to us. There was on-demand entertainment. So we could watch what we wanted when we wanted. Of course we chose Toy Story 3. I think even Matt had a glisten in his eye at the end. And we’re now addicted to Modern Family. Plus free bar = red wine. First glass (and it was served in a glass) in 3 months and it was so good we had to have two. 

&nbsp;

Once we landed it was easy to get to central Singapore on the MRT and we would have been at our hostel a teensy-weensy bit quicker had it not been for me directing us to Boon Reng instead of Little India (I blame the crap Lonely Planet maps inside maps) which meant 2 changes instead of 1 and then realise that we could have instead got off at Bugis which was on the same line as the airport. Doh!

Well we made it to Footprints Hostel in Little India and it is a decent enough place. No windows but who needs to hear the outside world? The room is compact but it’s cute, is completely furnished in Ikea and has sweet decorative stencils on the wall. This is the first time we’ve shared a bathroom and it seems fine. Boys and girls are separate so no smelliness in the girls showers. It has washing machines and dryers and free wifi and free breakfast and a huge flatscreen tv with big comfy sofas and a sparkly xmas tree in the corner. Home from home :)

Had dinner & beer for 10SGD at an open air food place called Shing Porridge on the corner of Kitchener Road and Verdun Road. It had anything you could think of to eat with noodles or rice and Tiger beer :) Having to get used to a new currency now. We are used to everything being in rupees so now trying to translate singapore dollars into rupees and pounds. (1 SGD = 35rupees = 50p).
