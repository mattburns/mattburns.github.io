Got a taxi to the Siam Square area of Bangkok to go shopping! The place was filled with giant malls, street sellers and small narrow back alleys filled with cute little clothes shops. A shopper’s heaven. I could have spent a fortune. 

Spent an extremely long time in MBK mall. The food mall was enormous. You buy coupons from the cashier and then go to one of the 40 food places to get your food. Each place doing a different dish. ![IMG_0680](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_0680.jpg)&nbsp;![IMG_0685](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_0685.jpg)

Also went to Central World Plaza mall in Siam Square and they had the new Mazda concept car on display which was lush! Look at those doors!

The reason for going here was to find the Skybar in the hotel there but we couldn’t even find the hotel so gave up and opted to go to another hotel with a high-level Moonbar for views of the sunset over Bangkok. Tried out the skytrain which we only ended up going one stop on and then realising the scale of the map was completely out as we walked for over half hour to get to Banyan Tree Hotel. 

We’d heard that they had dress-codes and we weren’t exactly looking the part in our travelling clothes and flipflops. Anyway we tried to get in but was embarrassingly turned away because of our open-toed shoes. Ridiculous nonsense. The only non-open-toed shoes I have with me are my running trainers. Should I wear those with my dress next time? Who makes up these snobby rules. Grrr.

Disgruntled we wandered back towards the skytrain in the dark and found a good old Irish pub called Molly Malones. There was no dress-code here. Instead it was happy hour and we drank our working glass beer out of Stowford Press pint glasses whilst wearing our open-toed feet attire. ![Molly Malones](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/01/P1040122.jpg)

Outside Molly Malones was an array of streetstalls and we found the busiest and had Kuay Taew – a delicious pork and vegetable soup served with a portion of rice on the side. Streetfood is so very good.

Opposite here was a night market called Patpong market. We hadn’t realised the kind of neighbourhood we were in until we walked through here. The knock-off crap they were selling wasn’t the interesting part. It was the proposition after proposition from pingpong show salesmen. They’d sidle up and flash a card at you with a full menu of pingpong shows available and quickly hide it again. It was brilliant! No we didn’t go to one.

Returning to Khao San Road, absolutely heaving with people, market stalls, streetfood, buckets, breakdancing kids, loud music.

We decided not to hang around as this was not Bangkok to us. It was such a fake touristy street. Like some cheesy Spanish resort.

We also had a problem to sort out. We’d found out today that our travel insurance was only valid for the UK. WTF! Somehow we’d managed not to select the right option when buying it online (I HATE COMPUTERS!) so it was invalid for Matt’s India hospital claim.

We spent over an hour on Skype to Endsleigh and finally sorted out proper global insurance which you’d expect from “gap year” insurance for an extra £300. Ouch. There goes more of the budget. We are just happy we found out on a small claim rather than something huge.

It was gone 11 by the time we’d dealt with it all so to de-stress we went to one of the restaurants on Soi Ram Buttri for more curry and beer and watched the street masseuses rub down half-drunk farang lying on sunloungers. A bizarre sight in the middle of a street. And unfortunately very like Khao San Road. But that was the area we were staying so I’m being a hypocrite here. The kind of area you need to have this notice three times on the same board in the hotel! What have we westerners done to this country?
