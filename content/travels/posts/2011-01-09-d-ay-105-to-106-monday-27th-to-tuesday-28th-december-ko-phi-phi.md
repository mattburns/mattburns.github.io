Picked up by a pick up truck to go to Koh Lanta ferry & 90mins later land at Koh Phi Phi. Doesn’t seem to be much accommodation left so we end up at Harmony House the cheapest the touts could find for us. It doesn’t start off well. One girl is checking out because of noise and smells. Another 2 girls want out as guys have been trying to bash their doors down in the night. Hmm doesn’t bode well. We cannot be arsed to make the trek back down to the pier to complain so wander off for brekkie to wait for our room.

The room we end up with isn’t as bad as we thought (although similar to India standards and a lot more money) and the woman on reception is less stressed and more helpful so we feel more relaxed about being here.

The beach Ao Lo Dalam is 10mins away and the view is breathtaking. Huge limestone rocks at either end and many beach bars inbetween.

Before sunset we hired a kayak and paddled to Monkey Beach and Ao Lo Lana a small beautiful almost deserted beach apart from a few kayakers. Apart from tearing a chunk out of my right foot and dunking my handbag in the sea whilst trying to get the kayak onto the beach it was good fun & very romantic :)

Tuesday was cloudy so we decided to walk up to Viewpoint, the highest point on Phi Phi, to look at the, um, views. Halfway up the steep climb the sun came out and it was hot hot hot and I am so unfit. It was worth it though as the views were amazing across Ao Lo Dalam and Ao Ton Sai. 

At viewpoint 1 there were these amazing butterfly bushes. So many different butterflies fluttering around one bush.

We’d read in the LP that you can walk down the other side to Hat Rantee (Rantee beach) so off we trot in our flipflops looking for the route down hill. Finally we find the signs and start down this overgrown steep pathway through the jungle fighting off mossies all the way. We see one couple coming up looking dishevelled and only two guys come down behind us. We’re not surprised with the state of the “path”. After a 30minute slog downhill we finally make it to Hat Rantee and it was worth it. It’s a small isolated beach with no roads and only a few resorts and restaurants.

We decided against the trek back up the hill of doom and got a longtail back to the other side of the island just as the rains came.

Other things we discovered on Ko Phi Phi:

1. Thai Pancakes ( come on there had to be something food-related)

2. What “buckets” are – mini versions of the punch bowls we used to make at uni

3. The sewerage system needs fixing as it reeks

4. Lying on cushions on the beach at night with a beer looking at the stars

5. Competing fire shows

6. The most tattoo shops in the smallest space in the world (and all having a steady flow of customers)

&nbsp;

Ko Phi Phi is a beautiful place and you can find peace and quiet as we found in Hat Rantee but the main parts are good for holidaymakers who want to drink lots. As Matt was poorly again we stayed off the alcohol most of the time so decided to move on after 2 days.
