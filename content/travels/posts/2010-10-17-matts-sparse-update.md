I’ve just found out that Karen’s Nan is being given print-outs of this blog, so a big hello to you from India! 

After the first few days I was almost ready to just get on a plane back home again. The people were rude, and the city was filthy.  
I’m over that initial culture-shock now (realising it was basically just Delhi) and am now really enjoying India. It’s a mad place, there’s no escaping that, but we’ve met some lovely people and already experienced a lifetime worth of bizarre events. 

When you walk down a street (intermittent sewage cover) in India you soon get used to every shopkeeper saying “Hello”, “Namaste”, “Where are you from?” (they all think I’m French for some reason), “Come in, it’s free to look” etc. Earlier a chap said to Karen: “Come in, I have beautiful clothes for your pretty face”. I pointed to my chest, smiled and joked: “For me? Oh thanks…” but he quickly, and seriously corrected me: “No, not you, I meant her”. Pfft. 

We watched James Bond (Octopussy) in Udaipur. Every other cafe/restaurant there shows it daily because most of it was filmed there. A cheesy touristy thing to do but we enjoyed it :) 

We also stayed up with some of the boys that work in our hotel there and drank Chai tea. Their English was a bit patchy and when combined with our sloppy accents we basically had two different conversations. Whenever we asked them a question they either pointed to the tea and explained that in India they call it “Chai” or gave me a lesson on how to light an incense stick with a match. 

When we went back to Delhi to watch the commonwealth games we got stopped by a mini TV crew that interviewed us for our thoughts on the organisation of the event. Not sure if it got aired since I basically said that it was a shame they left everything so late. It could have been so much more successful. I’m not saying we didn’t enjoy it, it was great, it just could have been so much better. 

In Darjeeling now which is very chilled, nothing like the India we’ve seen so far. Here’s a time-lapse video of a few hours of the view from our window:
