Moved guest house again as although the bed was extra comfy the plumbing had a dodgy odour and there seemed to be a loud woman banging on the doors at all hours. We are far too old for such nonsense. And we were glad to check out as the guy on the desk tried to charge us $15 instead of the 100,000 kip we were quoted. Very rude. Later happened to come across it on Tripadvisor and it was something like #76 our of #98 B&Bs in Luang Prabang and most of the reviews were terrible. Turns out the last reviewer had also been almost ripped off by the grumpy staff so I left an equally bad review for the place there and then.

Found the lovely Oudomphong Guest House mark II near the local market & night market for 10k less run by a very lovely friendly couple and it has free coffee & free wifi. What more can you ask for in one of the 20 poorest countries in the world? 

It’s quite hard to believe Laos is so poor as Luang Prabang is filled with beautiful hotels, restaurants and shops. Especially the cafe we went to earlier. It cost 27k for a 7up and a pot of green tea. To put it in perspective it costs 10k for a large beer normally. (Everything is compared to the beerometer). We were going to do a runner (before ordering I might add) but I’d already used the loo so felt obliged to order something.
