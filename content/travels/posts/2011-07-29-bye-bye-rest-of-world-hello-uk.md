OK so I haven’t updated the blog yet for the rest of Australia & Japan but it’s our last few minutes before getting on our final flight of the trip back to sunny England. We can’t quite believe it. 10 months and 15 days. It’s really over. Can’t quite believe it. Looking forward to seeing family & friends but not being back to reality. Have no idea what that is like now. And we have no idea what to do next. Any suggestions welcome! 

Bye bye Japan, bye bye rest of the world, hello UK.
