Vang Vieng is a 7.5 hour bus journey from LP. We were told we were buying a ticket for the 6 hour special VIP trip. They forgot to mention that when the 8am and 9am bus was already full, the 9:30am bus was in fact a less expensive VIP trip with no loo and dismal aircon that took longer but were happy to charge us the same price. If anyone else in Luang Prabang is going to Vang Vieng the ticket at the bus station costs only 90,000 kip for the 9:30 trip. We paid 140,000kip at a travel agent on the main street. OK it included pick up by a tuk tuk but it was only 10-min journey to the bus station. No way that cost 50,000kip! Be warned. (You do get “lunch” included which was a stop at 3pm and the journey was over at 4pm).

Aside from feeling ripped off and the suspension not being so great (one passenger looked green the whole journey and expelled his breakfast just moments before arriving in Vang Vieng poor guy),&nbsp; the scenery was spectacular. We navigated up and down the sides of mountains. One minute we’d be at the bottom with water running by, the next up the top with steep ravines either sides and unbelievable backdrops of the most surreal shaped hills.

At the top of one hill we had a loo stop and out the back of the cafe was another world:

They did however have the sickest thing I have ever seen and would ever want to see pickled in a jar next to the crisps and oreos. A baby bear. You could definitely make out the paws. It was disgusting.

Arriving in the centre of Vang Vieng was a shock to the system. Bye bye beautiful buildings of Luang Prabang, hello shacks filled with bars and restaurants complete with TVs showing Friends and Family Guy on loop. On first impressions I had a bad feeling about the place and it wasn’t even evening yet).

But then as we headed down to the river to cross over to find the quiet guest houses we realised our beautiful Vang Vieng is surrounded by striking limestone karsts.

We found room at Paradise Sunset on the far side of Vang Vieng. Bamboo bungalows on stilts (fixed with nails), a balcony with fab views of the karsts beyond.

I am torn at the moment with how I feel about Vang Vieng. It is completely schizophrenic. It has a bad vibe for me at the moment. Too many drunk kids lumbering around and loud music.
