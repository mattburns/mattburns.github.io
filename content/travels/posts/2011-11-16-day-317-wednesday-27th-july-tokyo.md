This may say this blog post is for 27th July but I am trying to write it up on 7th November, 103 days after the occasion so please accept my apologies for the tediousness.

I have no idea why Japan has taken me so long to write about and how I made time whilst travelling to write up the rest of the travels is a weird one. Anyone who reads this may think why the hell am I bothering when it was so long ago. But it is something I know I must do and I want to do. A project I told myself at the beginning I would finish so I will.

But maybe my subconscious doesn’t want to come to the end of the blog as much as we didn’t want to come to the end of our travels and get back to normality.

Anyway here goes…

We had our lie-in and packed everything up with main bags to go into storage with our smaller backpacks ready filled with supplies for the adventure this evening.

Ventured out for a short afternoon in Tokyo. Food was priority, no change there. Came across another one of those vending machine places, this time it was outside. We stood for a while staring at the machine trying to work out which kanji matched which picture and hoped we’d chosen a different soup each to try & some gyoza dumplings to share before trying to confirm it with a bewildered looking businessman who was patiently waiting in line.

We entered the establishment through those strips of plastic you get on large refrigerated areas and found ourselves in a long narrow room with just 6 stools along a breakfast bar facing the cooks. We handed over our tickets with confidence – our smiles saying yes we’ve done this before – and pulled up a stool. One each, not both on the same stool, that would be silly.

One of the cooks started chatting to the businessman who had followed us in and a few seconds later he was presenting us with two glasses of water he’d poured for us from the water tank in the corner, before getting himself a glass and pulling up the stool next to me.

The dumplings came (phew, we had ordered correctly) and we proceeded to pour soya sauce into our bowls. Our slave of a businessman immediately gestured that was a mistake and passed us the correct bottle containing soya sauce. Our confidence faded but we were grateful for the advice as the former bottle held some sweet sickly sauce that would never have co-ordinated with gyozas.

Next up were our soups. Turns out our different soups weren’t as different as we’d imagined. They were exactly the same pork & noodle soup except Matt had super-sized his. Ah well it was super tasty so who cares.

We walked out in a more sheepish mood but tummies filled minus the Japan book we’d “borrowed” from the hostel. So Matt had to put in another appearance and I think they were glad to get rid of us.

Spent the remainder of the afternoon nosing around Asakusa, stopping a little longer at the famous and pretty impressive Sensō-ji temple around the corner that we’d pretty much ignored previously.

All temples have a water fountain from which to wash your hands and face, and sometimes drink.

Around another corner old meets new with the [Asahi Beer Hall,][7] part of Asahi breweries. Unfortunately we didn’t have time to pop by for a brewery tour.

Followed by shopping, in an area of Tokyo that is gone from my memory, on a mission to find a head torch for tonight’s climb.

Mission accomplished in a random bag shop with the sweetest guy who couldn’t do enough to help us.

Now we’re fully prepared for a night on a mountain… \*cough\*
