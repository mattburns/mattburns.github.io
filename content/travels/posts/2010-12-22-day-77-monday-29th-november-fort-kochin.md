Finally made it to Cherai Beach on Vypeen Island. We’d meant to go last time we were in Kochi but our written-off Sunday put paid to that. Matt was feeling much better too. 

The plan was almost scuppered whilst on the way to the ferry. I was feeling a bit queasy so we sat down in the park for a couple of minutes. 2 seconds later a bloke came up to us to try to sell us an eel in a carrier bag – head and tail just poking out the top. Yep that helped me feel better. What he thought we were going to do with it I have no idea. When we declined (me clutching my turning stomach) he then asked if we wanted a photo instead! Of the eel or him, we weren’t sure, but quickly left him and the eel for dust.

The car ferry from Fort Kochin to Vypeen Island couldn’t have been easier. We paid our 2 rupees (3p) at the kiosk, walked onto the boat and 5 mins walked off again, jumped on the bus for 40 mins, then a 5 min tuk-tuk ride and we were at this long sandy beach with hardly anyone around.

The buses have women only sections at the front here so Matt was shooed to the back whilst I stood in front. 4 guys work on the bus. 1. Bus driver. 2. Conductor. 3. Guy at front door ringing bell once to let the 1st guy know he needs to stop the bus when people want to get on/off and ringing it twice to let the 1st guy know to get moving. 4. Guy at the back of the bus with a whistle who blows it whenever a guy wants to get on/off at the back to let the 3rd guy know to ring the bell so the 1st guy knows when to stop/start the bus. Talk about efficient. All the 1st guy needs to do is drive and listen to ringing bells.

Amazingly, the weather turned from a humid overcast grey, which has hung around for the past week, to blue skies and scorching sunshine as soon as we stepped on the beach. Made a nice change from our usual rain. Ironically it then became too hot that we couldn’t sit on the beach for more than 20mins without shrivelling to prunes so found a lovely beach bar overlooking the sea and had a couple of ice cold Kingfishers. Mmmmm. Not before saving a fish that was flipping and flopping about on the beach a bit too far from the sea and was being eyed up by a pair of crows by hoofing it back into the sea. (We are sure Mr Fish is now safe and well and back with his family).

Cherai Beach is on the west side of a long strip of land which is separated from the rest of Vypeen Island by backwaters. ![P1020984](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2010/12/P1020984.jpg) 

Just before sunset we walked over to the backwaters and were lucky enough to see a local using his Chinese fishing net. Matt set up the SLR for a timelapse and we watched as the guy lowered the net halfway, got into his canoe and adjusted each corner, back out of the canoe and lowered it fully. A little later his friend arrived near where we were standing and he whistled around the corner so the net guy jumped back into his canoe and picked up his friend and they both went to the net to pull it back up together. The sun was almost set by now but we could just make out a couple of small fish being scooped out of the net. Good enough for dinner perhaps.

Matt checked the timelapse and about halfway through the picture had gone dark. He also missed the sunset on the beach side. (I legged it over to take this quick photo of the locals with their mopeds).

But neither things mattered because it was lovely being stood on the banks of the backwaters with no-one else around watching our own personal show of Chinese net fishing. It was such a simple chilled peaceful way to fish. 

There were no tuk-tuks and a queue so although it was pitch black decided to start walking the 4km to the bus stop. Another couple who had been doing the same managed to flag down a passing tuk-tuk and very kindly stopped and gave us a lift. They were newlyweds from Shimla. We all boarded the next crammed bus (called Santa Claus??!) to Ernakulum when I realised we were meant to be going to the jetty. Doh. Trying to explain that to the conductor whilst the this time mental bus driver who thinks he is a F1 driver accelerates and decelerates and overtakes anything in his way at speeds too extreme for a rickety old bus full of standing passengers whilst music is blaring out of the speakers was no mean feat. Somehow we managed to get out at the right junction and grab yet another tuk-tuk to get to the jetty. Just in time again to walk straight onto the ferry back to Fort Cochin.

Loving the transport systems over here. They seem completely mad but they work so well and everyone uses them.
