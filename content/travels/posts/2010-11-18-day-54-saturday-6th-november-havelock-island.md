8am I woke up looked out the window saw blue sky and was like a small child on Christmas morning jumping around over-excitedly. Sunbathing here we come!

I rushed over to order to brekkie whilst Matt dragged himself sleepily out of bed and into the shower. Just as he came out of the hut the black clouds swallowed up the blue and the rains descended.

And it’s rained and rained and rained and rained. All day.

Nowt else to say. Nowt much to do on an island when it rains. Apart from eat, read, eat. Perhaps a bit of thought about what to do with the rest of our lives. (Didn’t get far with that). More eating (we found dairy milk and it was goooood – not all shrivelled up like the mars bar – like proper Cadbury chocolate you have in a selection box. So I did get to be a bit of a kid at Christmas today after all).

And in a brief moment between downpours I managed to capture a photo of one of the beautiful butterflies they have in India.
