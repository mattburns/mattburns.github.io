We have been away for 9 months now.

Awoke to a chillier day and made for another local attraction – the 10am opening of the dam. An amazing piece of engineering, apparently. Pulled up in the car park at 9:40 and made a nice cup of tea before wandering over 10 mins later to wait for the dam to open.

It finally dawned on us 15 mins later that the dam was already open. The water was obviously already gushing through and there was no magnificent ceremony to behold. They’d opened them bloody early.

Luckily there were only about 10 of us who looked foolish standing on a bridge staring at some gushing water through a concrete wall. What a let down. It was no Huka Falls.

By 10:30 we were back on the road (bye bye Taupo we will miss you, except maybe the dam) and onwards and upwards to Rotorua, a town seeped in both Maori history and hot water. 

Unfortunately the main geyser which rises 10m out of the ground is closely guarded by an extortionate entrance fee & a scary old lady at Te Puia. It being freezing cold we couldn’t be bothered to spend enough time wandering around the area to chance on the spouting geyser to justify the expense. 

Instead we went for the free option – Kuiria Park just off the town centre. And it wasn’t a let down. You drive into the carpark and can see clouds of steam in sporadic spots all over the park. Sporadic clouds rose from the park grounds. Steamy pools and bubbling mud holes. Just imagine the Bog of Eternal Stench and you’ll be close. This is why the town stinks of rotten eggs.

Even a free foot spa which was surprisingly hot.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_8040.jpg)

As fascinating as it was to see hot bubbling water rising through the ground creating cracks in roads it made us realise how close we actually were to the goings on beneath the surface of the earth and how volatile it is. Why build a town in an area so close to underground molten lava where parts of the ground can just disappear at any moment.

We didn’t stick around in Rotorua. We’ve found our mood for sight-seeing is directly proportionate to the amount of sunlight we get and it was very cloudy today. So we continued on to a campsite on the coast at Maketu in the Bay of Plenty (kiwi country of the fruit kind) and holed up there for the night hoping tomorrow would be sunnier.

We chose it specifically to get a cheap campsite to power up the camper (the fridge has a habit of defrosting itself after 3 unpowered nights) and our trusty IAC internet access (you can disconnect the broadband from the geek but…).

It’s in the middle of nowhere so the IAC access is as flaky as anything.   
It’s good to have a proper shower though.
