Firstly Happy Birthday to Tony, again. Sorry we sent you your birthday card a month early and sorry this message will be very belated as I am so behind on my blogs we probably will be back home before you get to read this. Hope you had a good one.

We had a pleasant day celebrating Tony’s birthday, our 250th day on the road and over 2000km travelled in NZ. Began with brekkie by Lake Mahinapua.

Treated ourselves to handmade maple & walnut fudge and fresh fruit ice-creams (boysenberry and kiwi) in home-made waffle cones from Sweet Alice’s fudge shop in Hokitika. Yum yum.

Followed by gourmet burgers & a glass of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc / bottle of Montieth’s black beer sat by an outdoor gas fireplace in Franz Josef glacier village topped off by 2 litres of West Coast brewing Co. black lager sat in the campervan in another random pitch-black DOC campsite which took 3 attempts to find. More evidence of my sat-nav skills diminishing.

Almost forgot the highlight of the day (quite possibly of the whole trip). The sock museum. With the world’s largest collection of sock-knitting machines. And so many varieties of socks made from sheep or possum wool. Has got to be one of the most bizarre places to visit ever but strangely interesting. I’d never really thought about how socks were made. It’s not something that crosses your mind is it – hmmm wonder where the seam is? Well this is how…

What I want to know is how do you shear a possum?
