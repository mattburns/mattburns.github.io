Today we leave Pushkar to go to Udaipur but it’s a shame to go as we’re loving it here. Even though it is a veggie, alcohol-free place!
  
It’s a small town with winding streets full of market stalls surrounding a lake and itself surrounded by hills.
  
Now we have been here a few days people are recognising us so we’re not being hassled so much. Rather just lots of Namastes and they let us move on. The shop owner round the corner from Rising Star now gets the water out ready as he sees us coming. The internet guy no longer asks for our ID or name. And the guy selling clothes next to Honeyt & Spice just says Hi instead of trying to flog us something.
  
We have become addicted to the banana & walnut bread from Honey & Spice. Going there every day for a couple of slices.

Also we moved hotel on Tuesday from skanky Hotel Sanjay to lovely clean Hotel Rising Star and they do lush banana pancakes for breakfast.

The first night we stayed there they had a festival in the hotel. A group of men sat cross-legged with instruments singing Hindu songs in front of a type of “altar” with the hindi god Ganesh and two photos of elderly people who we think must have died had garlands of orange flowers hung over them. They used microphones and a very loud PA system which boomed out into the streets around until 1am. That seems to be the norm here!
  
Incense burned all around and we together with some other travellers plus the wives dressed in bright-coloured saris and their children sat and watched the singing.

We didn’t realise at the time but that was the beginning of the Ganesh Festivities and yesterday was the main procession through the streets.
  
It was crazy and so much fun. The procession came down the main narrow street. There were dancing lads with drums followed by a truck load of kids throwing flowers followed by groups of lads dancing covered in pink powder paint followed by more trucks of kids and flowers and bananas (offerings to the god Ganesh,. god of good fortune).
  
After watching them crawling down the street for half an hour we decided to head down a side-street so we could head to the front of the procession again. But we managed to choose a street (narrower still) with more procession. Brass band after brass band. Flowers and bananas being thrown. Boys on horseback. Teenage boys spinning spears erratically and then fighting with them. I wanted to get away from these guys but they spotted Matt’s camera and all crowded round us wanting a photo. Then we had to have one with them! (That’s one thing we’ve had on a number of occassions now – indians getting their camera phones out and snapping us with their family or mates!)
  
I was then dragged off by a young girl asking me to dance with her and her friends. I gave in and went with her and we ended up dancing in the middle of a brass band – it was very surreal! (Matt has embaressing photos :)
  
We almost got stampeded at one point too by a cow as it got up onto the steps we were on (who said cows can’t go up and down stairs was wrong!) and headed straight for us. We had to jump off into the procession to get out of the way. Then i could see why – it had spotted Matt’s banana on the floor which he’d been given by the kids and wolfed it down in onw gulp! Then carried on it’s merry way back down into the street. 

Blue higgledy piggledy buildings, the streets carpeted with orange and pink flowers and people in brightly coloured costumes made it feel dream-like. There’s definitely something to be said about spiritual celebrations. 

There have bene some negatives – we were conned by a “priest” who took us down to one of the ghats and gave us flowers to throw into the water whilst chanting. Which was a good experience until he asked for a donation of 20, 50 english pounds. cheeky bugger. i gave him 50 rupees and walked off. matt gave him nothing, argued for a while until the guy gave up asking. It made me feel low for an hour or so.
  
it has been an emotional rollercoaster here. lots of highs but you get one or two untrustworthy sods who make you paranoid about everyone and who make you trust no-one. which is a good instinct but makes me feel paranoid and a bit standoffish to anyone who is nice to us. 

before i blather on too much longer and besides the downsides of having my ankles bitten to shreds by mosquitos and stroppy cows and cowshit everywhere here are the top bits of Pushkar:
  
– sunsets from the east side of the lake or a rooftop cafe
  
– banana lassi
  
– delicious banana pancakes @ Rising Star hotel
  
– rose jam on toast @ Honey & Spice
  
– smoothies @ Sonu juice bar on Sadar Bazaar
  
– a family following us up the narrow streets by our hotel, us thinking what are they up to and the husband finally plucking up the courage to ask for a photo of us two with his wife and son
  
– monkey watching – the first day we didn’t see a single one but since then we have seen hundreds! It’s funny watching them steal bananas fromm the market stalls and scamper up the electricity poles out of reach to nibble their swag. Quite a number hang around the rooftops near Rising Star, chancing a bread roll or a bottle of pop from someone’s kitchen. We watched as one nabbed a half bottle of fanta and bit the end so he could pour it across the rooftop and slurp it up. Another did it with some pepsi. They love their sugary drinks as much as the indian people!
  
We saw a couple of mother macaques with their babies hanging on tightly as they bounced from roof to roof. And another young macaque with half an arm that didn’t seem to hinder his tarzan skills on the electric wires to swing between buildings.
  
– chilling for hours and hours and hours…. 

I have just realised that list is 70% food and drink related! :)
