Steve from Wilderness turned up at 8:30am after driving from Auckland with our new van. It is so clean! 

hello new van (parked outside the motel room)![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P1070532.jpg)

The breakdown and motel in its way had been a blessing in disguise. We‚Äôd used the vast space in the room to organise ourselves and managed to get most of our gear packed up so we‚Äôll be ready for our flight. I doubt we‚Äôd have been this organised if we‚Äôd still been travelling around.

As Steve had gone to all that effort of bringing us a new van we felt we couldn‚Äôt just head down to Auckland in it. So we headed to the West coast of Northland to see the Ikiwi lakes and the giant Kauri trees in Waipoua forest. 

The former were a bit depressing as it‚Äôs been a grey day and the area is a little barren. Many trees seemed to have been chopped down. The only people around were the campsite kiosk employees. One of which came out of the loos in his string vest and boxers with his toothbrush hanging out of his mouth. We left pretty sharpish envisaging a shotgun being taken out of the ‚Äútrunk‚Äù. 

The giant Kauri tree Tane Mahuta was worth seeing. You drive through a valley of Kauri trees which blanket the roadsides. They‚Äôre so close you feel like you could be swallowed up by them and taken into the forest never to be seen again. This particular giant tree is called the Lord of the Forest with impressive stats.

It was pretty awesome.

There were warnings of Kiwis but we never came across any real live ones.

Got back to Auckland by 5pm via the Auckland Harbour bridge.

Opted for a ride up the Skytower for views from the Skydeck across Auckland as the sun set. And against tradition, instead of a cocktail, chose a coffee and kiwi pavlova combo to have whilst admiring the twinkling sprawl of Auckland from 186m up. Apparently pavlova is the national dish of NZ. Must find out why.

Some random person doing the random bungy thing from the top of the skytower. You bungy off then are lowered down to the ground very quickly. She took at least 5 mins to jump ‚Äì longer than my 1min in NZ üòÄ![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_8273.jpg)

Spending what we thought would be our last evening in Auckland in a trusty Top 10 Holiday Park in South Auckland not far from the airport.

Just found out that our flight tomorrow is in fact cancelled due to the Chilean volcanic ash cloud circling the Antarctic. 

Have re-booked our flight for Friday. So we‚Äôre in Auckland one more day.

Another day another challenge.
