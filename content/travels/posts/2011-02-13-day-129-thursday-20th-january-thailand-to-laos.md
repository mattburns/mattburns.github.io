After exactly 1 month in Thailand we are now in Laos. 

It was pretty simple. We jumped on a rickety old bus from Chiang Rai, our bags piled high at the back of the bus with everyone else’s luggage and our knees up under our chins (well Matt’s anyway) and 2.5 hours later we were dropped off at a tuk-tuk stand in Chiang Khong on the border with Laos. 5 min tuk-tuk ride and we were at the Mekong River and border crossing.

Also on the bus were two French guys. As we de-bussed at Chiang Khong, they were asking us the way to Vang Vieng. Umm Vang Vieng is in Laos yes but it’s quite far away. Kind of nearer to Vientiane than Huay Xai. _We want Laos not Vietnam and what is Huay Xai?_ Well Vientiane is capital of Laos and Huay Xai is the only border crossing between here and Vientiane we believe. When do you need to get there by? _Today_. Ah might be a problem. We’ll be getting a 2-day boat trip to Luang Prabang and then its another 6-8 hours bus from there. You can probably get a bus or something though.

_Merde!_, they were not happy bunnies. They had just come up from Chiang Mai to cross the border to Laos expecting Vang Vieng to be just a couple of hours away. We think they’d neglected to tell anyone they wanted Vang Vieng, instead just saying Laos and not realising how big a country it is.&nbsp; Turns out they had to head back to Chiang Mai to get anywhere near Vang Vieng in the next 24 hours! Poor buggers. They had no guidebook, no map. And their faces were a picture. Even we’re not that disorganised!

Anyway if you do want to get to Huay Xai, Thailand side of the Mekong you get your passport stamped at a little hatch, pay 40THB each to get a longtail across the river and at the other side fill in 2 forms, pay $35 each at another booth and you’re in Laos. Easy peasy.

We&nbsp; checked into B.A.P. Guesthouse and the little old lady booked us a slow boat to Luang Prabang starting at 8.30 tomorrow. We were going to shop around but it was like your nan booking it for you so we couldn’t say no.

Huay Xai seems to be a 1-street pony but it’s good enough for a 1 night stay. We found a good BBQ place down on the right past the Sabydee guesthouse and the T-junction. He knew exactly what we wanted. 2 Beerlao and plate of barbequed meat with chilli & coriander dip. Delish.

As we left dusk was coming so we headed to Riverside restaurant which overlooks the Mekong and watched the sun set over Thailand. Beautiful.

Just need to get used to the new currency again. 12,000 kip to the £1. When we withdrew £80 from the cashpoint earlier we were millionaires for 5mins until we checked into the guesthouse.

At Bar How? I opted for a glass of Melacca wine which has many healthy properties including improvement of circulation and the intestinal tract. It was like thin sweet sherry and very tasty. Matt was still peckish so we tried a Lao dish of Buffalo & eggplant with sticky rice. Another good dish. Liking this country very much already.
