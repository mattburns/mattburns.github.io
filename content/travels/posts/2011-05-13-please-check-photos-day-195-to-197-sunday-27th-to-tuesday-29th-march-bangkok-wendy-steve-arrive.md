Sunday we checked out of Sunflower Place and into Siam Heritage kindly paid for by W & S for our joint birthday pressies. What a place. So swanky. Iâ€™m going to sound like a complete child now but it had proper porters take our luggage to the room on one of those brass wheelie things. The bed is huge! The desk has one of those green lamps on it. There are satin dressing gowns and slippers. And a trouser press. Luxury. We feel like right scruffs.

After much umming and ahhing a bit of shopping in MBK for smart shoes (thatâ€™ll get him into nice bars) for Matt and some extremely sweet iced plum tea from a lovely little iced tea shack in Siam we trundle off to meet Wend & Steve at the airport as a surprise. As much of a surprise for us is receiving a text from Wendy saying theyâ€™d landed and there we were 2o mins from the airport. They were early.

Urging the skytrain to move faster I tell Wend weâ€™ll see her at the hotel and we finally arrive at the airport and leg it to arrivals. Just as they pootle down the travelator towards us we duck into a confused group of Japanese tourists and jump out from behind a pillar Surprise!! Sometimes we are so jammy.

W & S are a bit jet-lagged so we leave them to chill for a while until we meet at the roof-top terrace bar next to the roof-top pool & jacuzzi and have our complimentary orange juice plus obligatory beer. Hooray Wend & Steve are here! Shame itâ€™s so bloomin gloomy. The weather in Bangkok has taken a turn for the worst, grey skies have set in and itâ€™s decidedly chilly.

Ah well a couple more beers and we have our coats on and find some street-food. The most extravagant street-food in Bangkok we guarantee. Somehow we are sat outside a 7-11 at plastic tables with bottles of Singha (the same 7-11 the guy serving us just went into the shop to buy) and we are dished up a feast of seafood, 2 whole fish, squid, veggies, beef something or other and rice. The dishes never seemed to stop coming! No idea how that happened. The bill was more extravagant too. But hey weâ€™re on our holidays now!

Monday we meet up with Wend & Steve and head on the boat to the Grand Palace & Wat Pho.

We have all made sure weâ€™re wearing the right kind of clothes this time. I am not going to be accused of breaking the rules again.

One of the guards in the Royal Palace. Honestly this guy is real and life-size. The elephants on the other hand are not.

Guard no. 2 was ecstatic to be having his photo taken with two beautiful women.

We all went to Wat Pho. Although Matt & I had already been there we didnâ€™t mind going again as it is such an amazing place. It was strange seeing it again though as it was under renovation so many of the statues outside had been removed and the buildings were covered in scaffolding. Also after spending a few hours at the Royal Palace itâ€™s easy to see how you can get templed out and Wat Pho to not seem so impressive. But Matt & I still think itâ€™s the better of the two. And 7x cheaper.

Lunch at the local market was an experience for W & S. The women serving donâ€™t write anything down. They just shout it at the people cooking. Thereâ€™s a lot of yelling going on everywhere. We all end up with exactly what we ordered.

After a busy day sight-seeing it was only right that we went out for relaxing cocktails at one of the coolest bars in Bangkok â€“ Moon Bar at Vertigo in the Banyan Tree hotel.

The last time Matt & I tried to get in here we were turned away for not meeting the dress code. This time we felt like Julia Roberts going back to the shop after buying a good dress. OK so we went back to the same place but it was so worth it. This bar is absolutely amazing. I cannot recommend it enough. An open-top classy rooftop bar with only glass barriers to stop you falling over the edge, views across the whole city and the best cocktails. Yes it was cold (for the first time ever in Bangkok it was bloody freezing) and a bit breezy but we loved it.

The rest of the evening, as we were in Silom, we felt obliged to try the local entertainment of Patpong market. I wonâ€™t go into much detail here. Our first bar was disappointing. the second was definitely entertaining and the sights were both incredible and laughable. 

Patpong market was almost packed up when we emerged and we all were in need of a lie-in. Although Matt, Wendy & I managed to get down to breakfast. I was the only one to manage a full fry-up whereas Matt had 2 pieces of fruit. ðŸ˜€

Wendy & Steve were meant to be going to Krabi today but the whole of South Thailand is flooded and there is still torrential rain.&nbsp; They donâ€™t think they can get to Railay or Koh Phi Phi or Koh Lanta, all are only accessible by boat, so have decided to stay in Bangkok another night and decide what to do.

Matt & I moved back around the corner to Sunflower Place as we couldnâ€™t afford to stay in Siam Heritage again. 

We all went for a walk around Chinatown, ended going completely the wrong way and so back-tracked through the backstreets of Chinatown which was an eclectic mix of mechanical works. I have never seen so many piles of engine parts, cogs and scrap metal. 

Found a lush little dim-sum restaurant where Wend & I pigged out but the boys couldnâ€™t manage anything too substantial. Maybe weâ€™re more used to cocktails than they are?

We ventured further into Chinatownâ€™s tiny alleyways of shops selling anything and everything. Including a hat shop where you werenâ€™t allowed to try on the hats. Needless to say we didnâ€™t buy anything from there.

Even in the tiniest streets the mopeds are always there.

Wend was keen to do more shopping so we took them over to MBK. Not sure it was the right kind of place to hang around with hangovers. It wasnâ€™t very successful. I think a grand total of 1 pair of flipflops and 1 SD card was purchased. (The SD card though did come in handy as it allowed Wend to take a million and one photos instead of restricting herself to a few each day â€“ sorry Steve  ðŸ˜‰).

Tried abysmally to find a good pizza place for their last night but failed. The good place was closed by the time we got our backsides in gear and so ended up in an empty pizza place which was dire. I have no idea how some restaurants stay open long at all when their food is mediocre.

Wend & Steve are off down south tomorrow in search of sand and sea so we said our goodbyes tonight as theyâ€™re getting an early train and although I like to think I can get up early to say bye I know I canâ€™t.

Before they left though we managed to palm our teapot off on them. Left it Siam for when they get back so they can take it home. Result! Thanks Wend for offering to take it. Youâ€™re a lifesaver ðŸ˜€
