Today was a weird one. Stayed in Fort Kochin most of the day as our train to Goa wasn’t until 22:30. Braved the post office again to send a couple of parcels. Managed to get it all sewn up neatly and posted in less than 2hrs so not too bad.

Spent a lot of time chilling in Teapot. I am hooked on black tea and Jasmine tea now. Never thought we’d be drinking tea without milk but it tastes good. I tried their Indian Rarebit which was brown toast with a spicy cheese and vegetable mix on top and grilled. Sounds weird. Looks weird. It was actually really tasty.

Managed to bum around a couple more hours in Fort Kochin. Another walk past the chinese nets again and I was hit on the back by a dead fish which had been dropped by a crow. Very pleasant. Watched as fishermen used their nets. Tourists weren’t the only spectators. Dozens of crows loitered nearby waiting for their free dinner. As did an eagle which managed graciously and with impeccable timing dive into the net the moment the net left the water and select its dinner. Also spotted a rather large rat amongst the rocks. Even more pleasant.&nbsp;

After sunset got the ferry back to Ernakulum and randomly ended up at the International Book Festival. We must have looked very strange wandering around the book stalls looking sweaty with our huge backpacks. Over 50% of the books were in Malayam but there was a good range of fiction in English. The books were similar prices to in the UK. The DVDs on the other hand were a practically free and the seller was so enthusiastic about his world films and top directors we bought four. When Matt said he’d email him his thoughts, the guy chucked in another for free. How sweet!

Completed our Kerala journey full circle with a Pizza Hut visit. Unfortunately Matt started to feel ill again. I just thought he didn’t like the fact that I made him eat pasta instead of pizza but I don’t think it’s a good sign. Especially not for a 12hr train journey to Goa.
