Pretty much all of our 300th day was on Magnetic Island. Actually right up til the 21:30 ferry. 

Another fabulous sunshiny day, waking up to the sounds of birds and wildlife squawking and ferreting around outside the bungalow. Brekkie in amongst the rainforest (kind of), a couple hours of wifi to finally book our flights from Cairns – we’re skipping Melbourne and off to Sydney as want to spend more time in the sun whilst we can. Followed by an afternoon on the beach with chips and chocolate Billabongs. Fab (and getting fat).

When it started getting dark & cold we then realised we had quite a few hours to kill before our bus and ferry.

Caught the bus and hopped on the ferry with about 5 other people. A massive thing which swallowed us up and seemed a bad waste of petrol to go across to Townsville. 

We arrived in Townsville port to find the ferry station was closed. It was 22:00. Our bus was at 12:35. It was cold. We found a bench to half sit half lie on and tried to snooze. It got colder and colder. And we were zonked. 

By the time the bus came I thought we could sleep through/on anything…
