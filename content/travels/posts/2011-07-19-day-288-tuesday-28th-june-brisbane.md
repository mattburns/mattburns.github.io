Last night we got back to Acacia to find a breakfast basket on our bed. I forgot to mention we do actually have a fridge, kettle (an actual electric jug*!) & toaster in the room – bonus. Anyway the brekkie basket consisted of 2 bowls, 2 plates, a mini-pack of weet-bix for moi, a mini-pack of cornflakes for matt, 2 half pint cartons of milk (like what you get in playschool milk), two tetrapaks of OJ and portions of butter, jam & vegemite. Ah the famous Aussie equivalent of Marmite to try. Plus a teatowel (are we meant to wash it up afterwards?) We had to ask for bread. So imagine us attempting to sit comfortably on a double bed trying not to fall down the gap between it and the wall because it keeps shooting across the room on its castor wheels, balancing a bowl of cereal & plate of toast on our laps watching the Aussie equivalent to GMTV and realising morning TV has the same inept unfunny presenters all over the globe. 

The sun is out. Quick get and do some sunbathing! Off we stomp to the harbourside where half of Brisbane seem to be out to laze on the grass and get some rays and eat a daytime kebab (yes we were sober and yes it tasted good).

And have an obligatory ice-cream on the “beach”.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P1070588.jpg)

Hopped onto the City Cat ferry along the river under the Brisbane Story bridge which kind of wants to be Sydney Harbour bridge as it now also has a climb for an extortionate amount of money.

Disembarked further down the winding river at New Far with the idea of walking up through the area that I can’t remember the name of but has lots of live music and then onto Chinatown. Well we did just about do all that. But only after spending 3hours in Coffee Club trying to sort out where to go next, purchasing our East Coast hop-on hop-off Greyhound bus tickets and getting high on caffeine.

Found some good & bad live music at The Tempo Club where they were in the middle of their Battle of the Bands competition, tasted our first Aussie beer – Carlton Draught – and with no time to spare marched past Chinatown with a quick squizz at the main street before stomping back to Acacia for our last night in Brisbane.
