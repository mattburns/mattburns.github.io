Hell of a night being bashed around by stormy weather then gorgeous morning with the view we were hoping for. Pipping those Wicked campervans to the post for this spot on this tiny DOC island was worth the under-their-breath cussing we probably got from them.

Travelled to Wanaka passing more lovely things.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_6113.jpg)

We fell in love with Wanaka immediately and may stay another day or 2 or 3…

It has that alpine village feel set on a beautiful lakeside and surrounded by mountains.

Just spent an hour or so sipping excellent coffee and sharing scrummy hot chocolate cake with freshly whipped cream watching the world go by and felt really at home.

However you can’t eat chocolate cake without consequences and that meant one of our favourite past-times – walking up to the top of a hill. This particular hill was called Mt Iron just behind Wanaka town and at the top, just the two of us, sat eating sarnies with 360° views of picture perfect hills, mountains and lakes.

On the other side of Mt Iron is Puzzle World with the craziest leaning tower of Wanaka. Wow it was amazing. As Matt forced me to have a stupid photo taken, better not waste it. Oh it’s truly hilarious.

Staying at a campsite that has swings AND a trampoline. How cool is that? No-one else seems to be around so more exercise is had bouncing around.

We’d seen a curry house in town advertising an early bird menu and had been craving a proper Indian for a long time. The offer was on til 6pm. At 5:55 we were just leaving the holiday park and had a 10min walk. Would we make it? Well we managed to overtake a girl power-walking down the street (even with my ballet pumps on) and arrived fashionably late but not late enough for them to refuse us. A proper good curry it was too. And Kingfisher. Our first of both since India. Delish.

We attempted to stay out late by trying out the local beer-holes but failed miserably. The first was full of young scally-wags in a pool competition and the second was too quiet. After 2 beers we were back in our cosy campervan before 10pm. 

On the walk back the evening was crisp and we could see the Milky Way again. Plus another shooting star!
