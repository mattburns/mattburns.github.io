Hired bikes from the Youth Inn. Very Parisian with their little wicker baskets on the front.

Went back to the Immigration Office to renew our passports. It takes 24hours so we’re in Vientiane for a couple more days.

Most temples and museums are shut between 12:00 & 13:00 so we sat under the Patuxai (Arc de Triomphe) with a beer & a water to shade from the midday sun. Monday & Tuesday were overcast. Today it’s blue skies all the way & it’s a scorcher.

Took our bikes the 2km ride up the Th. That Luang to the Pha That Luang, the most important national monument in Laos. The LP says it’s a symbol of both the Buddhist religion and Lao sovereignty. It is a beautiful structure. All golden against the blue backdrop. ![IMG_2400](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_2400.jpg)&nbsp;<img title="IMG_2392" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: block; border-left-width: 0px; float: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-right-width: 0px" height="480" alt="IMG_2392" src="http://www.mattburns.co.uk/travels/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_2392_thumb.jpg" width="320" border="0" />

Surrounding it are a number of gorgeous temples, some new, some old. The newer ones now have gold spray paint adorning the ceilings and pillars whereas it used to be gold leaf. (In the Wat Phu in Thailand they were still using gold leaf). All sponsored by Walls, Lux and Persil…

Had local’s noodle soup for lunch. Extra chilli, lots of coriander & random things you can’t recognise. Delicious and a bargain at a quid a soup.

Whilst cycling to the COPE centre we spotted a barber’s shop and as Matt’s mop was evolving a life of its own he got it all chopped off. We both looked a little worried when the guy got the razor out straightaway and used it on dry hair but it turns out he knew what he was doing (even though he had TWO Westlife posters on the wall) and Matt’s £1.60 hairdo is as good as when we left in September.

With hair…![first haircut in 6 months](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1050084.jpg) Still with hair…![P1050088](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1050088.jpg)

With a lot less hair… (note the poster)![P1050092](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1050092.jpg) 

COPE is a centre for people needing prosthetic limbs usually due to them being blown off by a cluster bomb left over by America’s secret war in Laos which happened simultaneously to the Vietnam war but never seems to be mentioned. I’d been to the UXO centre in Luang Prabang which explained what cluster bombs were and how many there are left lying around but it didn’t really hit home how many people are affected by them until seeing the COPE exhibition. They can look like toys so many children play with them and the consequences are unimaginable. We watched a video where victims and/or their families were interviewed about the effect they’d had. And it wasn’t just in this part of the world. There have been 30 countries across the world where cluster bombs have been used and the leftovers are continually maiming or killing people.&nbsp; It was harrowing to watch and a real eye-opener. How many things we in the UK and I assume most Western countries are completely oblivious to. How much crap we are fed about wars and how much is hidden from us. We think we’re too clever to be taken in by propaganda but so much I have seen in the past 5 months has made me realise that I’m just as guilty believing things we are told or not told in our country. I could go on and on about this but I wouldn’t do it justice. Please have a look at the website [www.copelaos.org][9].

As Vientiane is a capital city of course it has a bowling alley. Possibly the only one in the whole of Laos. It was like stepping back in time to when you didn’t need a complicated computer system to calculate scores. A basic black and white screen with 10 boxes by 6 boxes were all you needed and your name couldn’t be more than 3 characters long.

With a Beerlao in hand we played the first game and I was trailing all along and when I managed to get a strike Matt only went and got one straight after. But with his last game played he was on 97 and I was on 84. It wasn’t possible to beat him, or was it? I got an 8 then a spare. Whoop I could do it. All the pressure was on my third and final ball. Whoosh it rolled down the lane and completely cock-eyed I scored 3. Nooooo what a crap bowl. The black and white screen kept us in suspense (for at least a second) and there it was a DRAW!! Hooray! A certain person wasn’t impressed but I was ecstatic!

Opted for a second game as two plates piled high with noodles turned up. They put a table and 2 chairs by the lanes and there we sat eating our dinner inbetween playing a game of ten pin bowling. Another surreal experience. It did everything for Matt’s game and nothing for mine as I deteriorated rapidly into scoring 1s and 2s all over the place. Disaster. Matt won respectably and I with my last mouthful of noodles was punished even more as the hottest chilli I have ever tasted hit the back of my throat and burned like a hot poker until it went numb!

Proof Matt won the next game

It was only 21:15 when we left the bowling alley so we headed to the night market along the main coastal road Fa Ngum. It was similar to Luang Prabang with lots of beautiful things but on a smaller, less cramped scale and I bought a pretty woven makeup bag for £2. 

Still didn’t feel like going back and ended up with a pitcher of Beerlao in a rooftop bar overlooking the Mekong (except for the fact that it was dark so no river in sight). The bar was packed and once again our memories of Phuket & Chiang Rai were resurrected as the number of young girls hanging out with older European men was above average for it to be true love. I guess because we’re in a capital city and it’s so close to Thailand it’s going to attract that kind of business. Luckily we haven’t seen it anywhere else in Laos. And it’s meant to be illegal for a Lao person to have sex with a non-Lao person before marriage. I guess laws never stop everyone.&nbsp;
