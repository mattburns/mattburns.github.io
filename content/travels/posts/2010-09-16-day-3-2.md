Today is the third day since we arrived in Delhi.

This place is crazy. The roads are chaotic and you assume that there must be crashes every five minutes but somehow, everyone manages to weave in and out of each other as if controlled by some collective brain. Walking around the main parts of Delhi is pretty tiring. Touts constantly approach offering _helpful_ directions to the _official_ tourist office where you can book trains and trips. I spent 20 minutes waffling to some guys in a park that were friendly and just chatted about travelling before Karen realised they were touts playing the long game. I’m hoping Delhi is a baptism of fire for India because I wouldn’t describe this as relaxing!

We head to Agra tomorrow to have a goosey at an old building called the Taj Mahal apparently. The guide book doesn’t have many great things to say about Agra and it’ll probably be more hectic than here in Delhi but, as they say, a change is as good as a rest. We’ve already booked an escape route from there though to Pushkar which I’m really looking forward to.

It’s not all bad though. Tried some delicious street food and had some excellent food in a restaurant earlier. No Delhi-belly yet. That’s for a future post.

I’m not sure how often we’ll update this blog, but I’ll try to keep it down to just the interesting bits.

Cheers, Matt
