It was still dark when the alarm sounded at 5:45. It’s becoming a common occurrence with us, early mornings. Are we old? (We definitely have the crows feet & grey hair these days. It’s hard work all this travelling malarkey.)

But this was for a much better reason than some bus driver waking us up to get a move on. We were off diving!

We had to be at the marina by 7 and by some miracle were up and dressed with cheesy vegemite coated toast in hand we were out the side gate, a swift gallivant through town and down to the boat RedKist on pier E (or finger as they call it here??) just in time. 

Though it didn’t matter. We didn’t leave the marina until 8am. But then we were there early enough for coffee, cake & fresh pineapple. And we tried Lamington for the first time. You see trays of the stuff in bakeries & supermarkets but we’d never found the budget to buy any. They were yummy. Must get more of those!

The journey to the reef was of mixed emotions. Matt became part of the seasickness clan, standing on the back of the boat with at least fifteen others with rolling stomachs. Lucky for him he wasn’t actually puking unlike most of the crowd huddled over their brown paper bags. I popped out there for moral support and ended up having the middle finger on my right hand crushed by the sliding door when we hit a particularly big wave. It took my mind off the swaying boat I’ll tell you. (And is still painful 12 hours later – sympathy please).

Apparently the latch on the door broke the last time they were out on rough waters and one of the crew members had crushed the same finger just yesterday. Hmmm…

Anyway neither seasickness or squashed fingers could prevent us from diving and off we went at 11:25 into the slightly chilly choppy but clear waters of the GBR.

You can see a lot of the coral from the boat. It reaches just above the surface in many areas and the deepest part of the ocean was no more than 12metres. They were shallow dives which was good with our nervousness after so long since our Andaman dives. Still once I’d unravelled myself from the guide-rope and we’d kicked back against the current to the back of the boat and followed the anchor line down the nerves passed. 

Although we didn’t see a great deal of sealife, no turtles or sharks as expected, it was a great experience swimming through corridors in the reef. Our diving guide passed a sea cucumber to me which promptly spewed its white intestines all over my hands as a defence mechanism. Matt caught the sea cucumber after I kind of pushed it in his direction and luckily only had some leftovers stick to him.

I tried for most of the 30min dive to get it off rubbing it on coral the guide showed me and longer on the boat scrubbing with paper towels and soap. It was like a fine white net of glue and chewing gum. No-one would go near me until it was gone. It can sting your eyes apparently. 

Had a really good day on the boat. We were even fed a hearty lunch and chocolate cake mid-afternoon. Perfect. _(Had to get a reference to food in somewhere)._

And on the way back no-one had problems with seasickness. Good cake is obviously the best preventative.

Great Barrier Reef was a little disappointing for sealife. We saw fish but most we had seen before in the Andamans like Parrotfish, Clown Anemone fish & Angelfish. Maybe we were spoilt with the Andaman sea because it is unspoilt. But, man, we dived in the Great Barrier Reef today and it was amazing. One of my dreams I’d never thought I’d see realised. Lush.
