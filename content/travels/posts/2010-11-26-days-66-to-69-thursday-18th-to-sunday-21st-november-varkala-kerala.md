It’s 21st November – Happy Birthday Ali!

Sat on our balcony at Mummy Bamboo House listening to the rain fall steadily through the palm trees onto the dirt tracks below and forming murky orange rivers. The sheets a local lady just hung up on lines between the trees are being thoroughly rinsed again. The taxi Rani’s husband drives is keeping dry under the makeshift tarpaulin garage. The monsoon season is well and truly back. Maybe it never went. It has rained everyday we have been in Kerala. Normally it comes in the evenings whilst we’re eating dinner on one of the cliffside restaurants and we watch the lightening illuminate the skies above the sea. Sometimes a brief spell during the day and everyone runs for shelter in the shops or heads into the water if on the beach as then you’re wet whatever but the sun always wins. Today it has lost the battle. It is 13:30 and the sky is full. No sunbathing today. It’s warm and dry on our balcony so no complaining. Matt can read (he’s hooked now) and I can blog and bore everyone to death. 

Since Wednesday I can’t say that we have done much at all. We managed a day on the beach when it was absolutely boiling. Matt resisted a sun umbrella as long as possible until he was burnt on the shoulders, then literally 5 mins later the clouds rolled in and 20 mins later it was raining again! Whilst swimming in the sea Matt thought he was picking up some rubbish and realised it was half a dead eel which then managed to find it’s way onto the beach and lie there looking gormless at us for the rest of the day. The other half turned up a little later further down the beach. Why it was torn in half I don’t want to know. Could have been these birds as they seem to like eating anything they can get their beaks into.

I have started yoga. The first real attempt at exercise in 2 months. So far I have been to three 90min classes in as many days and feeling pretty good for it. It’s on a rooftop covered with a bamboo and palm tree shelter and taught by Santhosh (Kasi Yoga), who looks very much like what I’d imagine a yoga teacher to look like. Long hair, goatee, lots of beads. It’s different to yoga I have done in classes at home (although that was 8 years ago so my memory is pretty faded) in that the stretches last for minutes and the relaxation/meditation periods in betweens stretches can last as long as 5mins. It sometimes feels a little disconcerting (especially if there’s a powercut) sitting/lying there with your eyes closed for such a long time with no sounds. You wonder if everyone else is still there. Another difference is that Santhosh will deeply massage your back to help the muscles stretch and he knew I had a lower back problem straightaway. So hoping that the yoga and massage is helping rather than hindering that. It’s giving me time to chill out for a while each day and giving Matt some peace & quiet for 90mins :)

We spent all of Saturday in the Chillout Lounge as they have free wifi trying to sort out our route from here to Mumbai. Once we’d had our mixed up breakfasts (our eggs were on each other’s plates and my “spjnach sauce” which was part of the special breakfast was non-existent), it took us 6 hours and lots of compromise. At first we wanted to see if we could change our flight out of Mumbai to Singapore to an earlier date as we hadn’t planned to spend 3 months in India (it only turned out that way because we didn’t go to Nepal due to the visa issue) and we’d like to spend more time in South East Asia. To do this we had to be able to get to Mumbai earlier. The flights from Kochi looked like they were £25 but when it came to booking they went up to £150. Plan A was abandoned.

Plan B – to go to Hampi near Goa and the Ajanta and Ellory caves near Aurangabad. Kirsten & Nick had recommended them highly as had Sam. Unfortunately trying to get trains anywhere at the moment in the right order is the biggest challenge. After much deliberation and ranting at Cleartrip we settled on Hampi only. We’ll be in Kerala til the 30th and then Goa/Hampi until 8th and then Singapore here we come! (Can’t wait to hear stories from Ben & Dulcie who are there at the moment, lucky things!)

<strike>Our</strike> Karen’s (_minor correction needed there –Matt_) highlight of the day was hearing Last Christmas by Wham followed by Mad World. Both excellent xmas songs but it doesn’t feel xmassy here at all. Although Golledge insists xmas is nowhere to be seen at home as it’s only November (or Movember – have seen lots of guys with the dodgiest looking tashes) my mum & Wendy are off xmas shopping in London today. And it’s apparently cold and miserable there so I guess it must be just around the corner.

Mustn’t forget my 3rd grey-hair related comment of the trip so far. We were headed back from the main beach past numerous shops with people saying the usual, “You want t-shirt/dress/bedsheet…Come look in my shop…I give you good price, etc etc” when a young boy sat outside one shop came out with something completely different. “How old are you madam?”, he asked innocently, “ your face is young but your hair is old”. Hmmmm pass the henna….
