It’s a bank holiday in NZ today for the Queen’s birthday. 

5.5 aftershock whilst in Timaru. Matt was in the van and felt it shake for 30 seconds. I was in the shower block and felt nothing. Apparently the epicentre was 40km south-west of Christchurch. We’re heading in that direction today. Some damage to buildings and roads reported.

Passed over the longest bridge in New Zealand. Enough said about that. That’s all I _can_ say anyway.

Couldn’t resist cheese-tasting at the local handmade cheese factory in Barry’s Bay on the Banks Peninsula, a very beautiful part of the South Island. This marked 4000km around NZ. We were definitely not going to buy any. Needless to say we came away with some Peninsula Blue. 

Took a wrong turn and ended up on a very cool dirt track along the edge of the sea, stopping off for lunch halfway at an old jetty, sea views out of all three sides of the van.

Day ended in Akaroa, a quaint little town and harbour with sweet western and shaker style art & souvenir shops selling delicious fudge with a gert big bloody Shell petrol station dumped in the middle of it. Ignoring that it was a pretty place with a French Riviera feel to it and was added to our favourites list.
