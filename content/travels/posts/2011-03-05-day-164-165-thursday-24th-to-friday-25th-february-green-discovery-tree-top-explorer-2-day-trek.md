Don’t know where to begin with the last two days. Out of this world is one way to describe them.

Tree Top Explorer is a new venture run by Green Discovery that has only been running 2 months.

Our trek begins 90mins outside of Pakse at a village south of Paksong in the heart of the Bolaven Plateau famous for its coffee. We stop at a house with a woman roasting coffee beans in a wok over a low fire and where thousands of coffee beans are drying in the backyard.

Collect our full body harness, helmet and “braking stick” and we’re on our way. There are about 12 tourists and 5 guides at this point.

Before reaching the coffee plantations where we see men picking the coffee beans we stop to look at more coffee beans drying in the sun and hear how the different types (skin on/off) can mean a difference between the quality and therefore the price they can sell – between 20,000kip per kg and 35,0000 kip per kilogram. In current exchange rates that’s £1.65 to £3 per kg.

The trekking continues past the coffee trees and into the jungle and maybe an hour later we have our first use of our harness. The swing bridge. Both scary and beautiful we wobbled across the bridge which traverses a waterfall and this is where we sit for lunch. As it’s the dry season there is not so much water so we’re able to sit on the rocks with water around us as we eat our traditional Lao lunch of sticky rice, dried meats and fish, veg and chilli tomato sauce.

More trekking and we arrive at our first zip line. A mini one to get us used to trusting the contraption wrapped around our body.

And then we’re off. Zip line after zip line. With some lowering on rope through platforms to zip lines below. Somehow are at the top of an amazing valley blanketed with jungle and waterfalls and invisible wires until you get up close that take you on exhilarating rides across the front of waterfalls.

The more we did the more confident Matt became and started bouncing off the platforms to start flying through the air. Me I’m always a bit more of a scaredy-cat. The final one they were all shouting jump jump as the wire changes height suddenly as it takes your weight. I ran to the edge with full intentions to jump and my annoying sensible brain kicked in and stopped and sat down, feet dangling over the edge and I slid off the end! At the other end the guide was shouting “brake, brake, BRAAAKE!” but although I was putting all my strength into pulling down the branch on the line nothing happened and I ended up knee-capping him as he protected me from hitting the tree.![IMG_2718](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_2718.jpg) 

A little more hardened trekking and by 4pm we arrive at our lodgings for the night completely camouflaged by the jungle we hadn’t noticed the village until we were practically on top of it.

And what a setting. I cannot describe well enough the sheer magnitude of the waterfall which was the backdrop to the lodge. Again it wasn’t as large as it would be in the rainy season but for us it was the largest waterfall we have ever seen. Utterly stunning. 

You know how after being somewhere for a few hours with nice scenery you get used to it and it becomes oh yeah there it is again that’s nice. This was different. You can’t get used to it. Dinner, breakfast and lunch were served with this magnificent backdrop and every time we looked up at it our jaws dropped and we felt like it was a dream.

Another long-time dream of mine was fulfilled that day. A waterfall shower. Again I can’t describe it well enough and now it feels like another dream. Standing on the huge rocks under the pure fresh (brrr cold) water looking up at the mountain behind was completely unreal to us. How many journeys we have been on this trip and how many things we have experienced we keep thinking that we could experience anything better still. But this beat everything else. Well almost on a par with Sandakphu and seeing the Himalayan skyline.

A group of four from Thailand joined us later for dinner and they turned out to be from the Thailand National Geographic who are writing a piece on green adventures. So we may get to be in a proper publication. You never know.

True air-conditioned accommodation – all night you could hear the waterfalls ![IMG_2761](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_2761.jpg) 

The only entrance to our treehouse – great fun in pitch black :) [][12]<img title="The only entrance to our treehouse" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: block; border-left-width: 0px; float: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-right-width: 0px" height="480" alt="The only entrance to our treehouse" src="http://www.mattburns.co.uk/travels/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_2767_thumb.jpg" width="320" border="0" />&nbsp;![P1050321](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1050321.jpg) 

Tuesday morning Matt & I opted for another open-air waterfall shower and this time no-one else was around so it really felt unreal. Just us 2 stood under the waterfall in the middle of the jungle.

Today we had two long zip lines which lasted a minute each. Wow! As we each did the second one the guy from National Geographic came across the first zip line in tandem with a guide in order to film us going across. 

Just about to start the first 400m zipline… (that’s my “I’m excited really I am and not at all scared” face)

Matt filmed me doing the 2nd one – here’s the link to YouTube:

And Matt filmed himself on the zipline but unfortunately its too big to upload at the moment so will be coming to a YouTube near you soon…and here it is

Final activity of the trek was the Via Ferrata:

![The Via Ferrata](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_2801.jpg)

Here I am at the beginning of the Via Ferrata about 1min before I freaked out because I remembered I didn’t like heights, dropped my camera case into a tree which had to be recovered by one of the guides and then be taken up to the top by another guide. It was silly really. After the initial bit I’d got over it and realised how stupid I was but the guides were really good and took me up all the way to make sure I was safe. 

![IMG_2816](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_2816.jpg) 

Matt needless to say loved every minute of this as much as he’d loved the zip lines. And I couldn’t believe I let if affect me that way as I’d been fine leaping off ravines a couple of hours before! 

![P1050354](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1050354.jpg) 

The climb up was worth every drop of sweat as we reached the top of the waterfall we’d once been at the bottom of. We could see the rest of the group at the lodge waving to us.

![P1050366](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1050366.jpg) 

A bit more perspiring took us upwards some more and onto level ground through the coffee plantations. The last 5 mins we hitched a ride in the back of the truck. It was pretty difficult to get out as the legs had already started to seize up!

Matt met these cheeky monkeys around the back of the last pit stop.
