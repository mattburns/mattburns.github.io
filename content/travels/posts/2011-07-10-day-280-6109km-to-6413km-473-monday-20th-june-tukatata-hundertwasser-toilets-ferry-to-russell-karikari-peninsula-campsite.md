Today was a different story. It was action-packed to the gills.

Awoke to a very cool view out the back of the van. Not a bad little campsite location-wise. Shame about the cold showers.

First stop was Whangarei. We weren’t going to bother as we’d heard it wasn’t a very interesting town. But we thought as we’re passing through and this would be the only time we’d ever have the chance to see the largest falls in NZ, we’d stop for 5 mins. And here they are. Not bad for a 2min walk from a carpark on the outskirts of a dull town.

Our journey took us next to the marina and beach in Tukataka and the sun was out in force. It was beautiful.

A brief stop in Kawakawa to see the Hundertwasser toilets, not dissimilar to Gaudi in style. And share a seafood chowder.

Then a hop on the ferry to Russell, just around the corner from the original capital of New Zealand.

Russell is a pretty marina with a pebble beach. Most of the shops were closed due to being out of season so it was ghostly quiet. It has the oldest church in the country which we were surprised to hear Darwin donated money to for building costs, an authentic Thai restaurant with an NZ-registered tuk-tuk and pirates in the harbour.

We almost bought a piece of artwork in one of the few shops that were open but were put off when we found out it was only a print. How annoying. Annoying that we haven’t got a clue about artwork. We’re rubbish.

There is also part of a flagpole at the top of a hill in Russell which has an interesting story about how it was erected and destroyed 4 times. Here’s the story (if you have a magnifying glass to read it).

And the flagpole itself.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P1070507.jpg)

Our day ended with a return trip on the ferry, a whizz along the northern coastline through a little place called Cooper’s Bay (we get everywhere) and finished at the DOC campsite on the Karikari peninsula where we settled in for the night parked between two large trees and no sign of the coastline whilst the rain & the wind came again.
