We’re off to meet up with Wend & Steve in Bangkok. Given ourselves a day to get over the border so we get there in time!

Haha of the day: Matt tried to give some not quite so poor woman some money whilst she was just sat waiting for the bus. Much embarrassment.

The Poipet border crossing was quite painless. 20 mins queued up on Cambodia side to get our departure stamp followed by 30mins on the Thai border to be let in.

We’d been on a coach from Battambang to Poipet (via Sisophon 1 hour stopover to change buses) but in Thailand we were bundled into a minivan. No problem except for the numerous un-needed stops on the way to Bangkok and not being allowed to get out anywhere other than Khao San Rd. 

But we got to Silom and found our back-alley hotel Sunflower Place just round the corner from the hotel Wend & Steve have booked. It’s a nice little place just past all the gay massage parlours.
