Our bus wasn’t until 14:25 and the guy at the hostel couldn’t have been nicer. Maybe because we hadn’t been so impressed with his recommendation. We could use all the facilities until we left and he’d give us a lift to the bus station.

So we borrowed the bikes again and yes today is another scorcher. It’s the hottest we’ve felt it in Oz. 

And off we cycled in the heat to the 826metre pier and walked to the end passing countless fisherpeople. There were people of all ages sat with their rods dangling into the water.

There were a couple of 9/10 year olds fishing and one ran off with the other’s rod. So there was a bit of a jovial altercation and lots of insults thrown both ways. The reason for mentioning this non-interesting event is to share the best insults I have ever heard. “You’re a JB”, “Yeah you’re a Justin Bieber”, “Justin Bieber, Justin Bieber”. Genius. 

We managed to get the bikes back in plenty of time for our lift which was quite impressive seeing as it was 5km each way and we had time for a spot of sunbathing. 

And off we went in the glorious sunshine on a Greyhound bus journey of 4 hours. Oh joy.

Now at a the lovely 1770 Southern Cross backpackers hostel which is 2km from Agnes Water town nr to the [Town of 1770][6] where Queensland was “discovered” by Captain James Cook on his 2nd landing in the year 1770. The hostel is set in huge grounds and tonight we’ve got our own 4-bed dorm in a Canadian style hut with ensuite bathroom called Ireland. The communal areas have a ping-pong table, table footy & pool table. And there’s a huge campfire burning. Always a winner.
