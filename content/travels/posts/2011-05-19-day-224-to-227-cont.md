Outside of class we only actually went and did something other than eat & sleep. We went shopping! They have a night market with so many lovely stalls selling souvenirs, clothes and jewellery and a very cool domed bar/restaurant in the centre. Needless to say I re-filled another bag to replace the one Wendy & Steve had kindly taken home for us. And bought a gorgeous silver ring typically on the day that silver was at an all time high so they were reluctant to barter or even sell it to me at one point. It’s worth it though. Also bought some Khmer kramas (scarves) ready for winter time in NZ. 

In the Angkor Night Market they have a “cinema” which shows a documentary about Pol Pot. It was basically a warehouse with an archaic projector and it had to be the worst documentary either of us have ever seen. It didn’t make sense. It didn’t flow. It was hard to tell who was who and when things happened as it jumped all over the place. Sometimes it had subtitles and you couldn’t see them because they blended into the background or were over the top of some other text on screen. The only new facts we learned were that the Vietnam war killed 600k and Khmer rouge killed a quarter of population in 3.5 years (1.75m). Insane stuff. It was such a shame because it is an opportunity to teach tourists about the true history of Cambodia and we came out more confused.

And last but not least I must mention that Matt’s little [SCF][2] project has taken off!! All the work he’s been doing in the past 3 weeks, 7 months and over the past 2 years has paid off. On Tuesday he sent an email to a couple of techy websites. And suddenly on Wednesday the hit rate went from 50 per day up to 30,000. We thought it might have been a one-off but then Thursday there were even more. 

Turns out a few blogs like PhotographyBlog and Wired have written a little article about it and it’s all over Twitter. So exciting. It’s a shame we’re having to head back to Bangkok as it would have been good to have a few more days seeing how it does and think about what to do next. Will have to wait and see.

Bye bye Siem Reap. We’ll miss you. 

We’ll miss…

The delicious food.

The sudden thunderstorms and flooded streets that give us an excuse to dive into a bar.

The persistent girls shouting massage massage as you walk by.

The hundreds of fish massage tanks all over the city.

The constantly dirty feet. We either have really tanned toes or they’re stained with the red mud.

The scrambled eggs & toast or fried eggs & toast everyday for breakfast at PGL.

The pineapple in our bathroom drain to help cover the dodgy drain smells.

The malaria tablets. Only 4 weeks from now and we can stop completely.

Palm Garden Lodge and everyone there.

The real Siem Reap.

So many people only see the centre which is filled with restaurants, cafes and bars geared up to the short-term tourists. Near the airport there are so many extravagant hotels which ship people in and out and they don’t see what’s just around the corner.

Poverty, muddy roads, open sewers, flooded communities. 

But a lot of happy smiling people who get on with life with little to their name. Kids who play outside together and run around free as anything because the neighbours look out for them.
