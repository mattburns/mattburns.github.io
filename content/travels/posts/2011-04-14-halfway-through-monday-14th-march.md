I only went and forgot to say in my blog on 14th March that we’re HALFWAY THROUGH! (well when we were in Phnom Penh we were and I can’t even remember what we did that day. I presume it involved one or two Angkor beers).

Funny how you can spend 10 years thinking about going travelling and here we are 50% done already.

6 months have flown by and from now on we’re on the way back….realised we’d better start thinking about a life plan of action.

And strangely I am posting this after 7 months “on the road” so even less time to think now.
