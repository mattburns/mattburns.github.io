Found a great place to park up the campervan smack in the centre of Wellington harbour-side. It‚Äôs basically a carpark but there are spaces for motorhomes for which you pay $50 per 24hr period and there are even keypad entry loos and showers. Might be a good business idea for any big city in the UK üòâ

This meant we could park up all day to explore Wellington, have a couple of drinks and an evening out and come back to the van to sleep. 

Loving Wellington. Tested out the LP walking tour as didn‚Äôt really know where to start. This included a ride on the old-fashioned cable car (or vernacular as we‚Äôd call it). It‚Äôs really a commuter car picking up and dropping off Wellingtonians and university students at various stops on the hill. It‚Äôs very quaint and the free Cable Car museum at the top is worth a 2-min whizz round. Matt insisted on the silly photo opportunity.

So I insisted on the standing in a huge cylindrical tree photo. Haha revenge!

On the advice of the cool old guy selling cable car tickets we only went one way and meandered back down through the Botanical gardens. A highlight was the kid‚Äôs playground (14 years & under)‚Ä¶

And the Cacti and Succulent garden.

Mustn‚Äôt forget the outdoor lift camouflaged by vines and shrubbery which helps you miss out at least a 2-min stretch of pathway.

The rose garden was pretty even without many roses, it being winter and all that. I‚Äôm sure it would be beautiful in the spring and know that mum & nan would love it.

The final part of the garden walk takes you through an old cemetery which appears to have a whopping great motorway across the middle of it. Not sure there‚Äôs much RIP-ing going on there.

It‚Äôs lunchtime and we find Chow Main Cube in the business district dishing up superbly tasty freshly cooked Hokkien noodles served in one of those American-style boxes with a cute handle and chopsticks. Hooray we‚Äôre back in Asia! (Did we say we were missing it?)

Stuffed to the brim we end up back at the van for a quick cuppa (we are VERY old now ‚Äì we blame the campervan) and spend an hour trying to work out a plan of action for the rest of our trip. Love New Zealand (esp Wellington) but we are cold and it keeps bloody raining. We want some sun! Do we try Oz and hope it‚Äôs sunny there or head somewhere like Fiji? Turns out we can go Auckland ‚Äì> Fiji ‚Äì> LA ‚Äì> home for ¬£100 extra. Hmmm is that really what we want though? We‚Äôre so darn close to Oz it would be silly not to go! So leave the decision for another day‚Ä¶

We ditch the walking tour and go straight to Te Papa the national museum. Although distracted by a guy creating bubbles on the bridge. He‚Äôs experimenting with different compositions apparently.

An impressive monster of a building right on the waterfront it is very well designed and has lots of cool interactive science-y stuff to keep Matt happy. There‚Äôs a lot of interesting info about how NZ was formed, the Ring of Fire and where all of the volcanoes are related to the earthquakes that have occurred. We didn‚Äôt realise that over the past century there has been some kind of earthquake, tsunami or volcano eruption pretty much every other year somewhere in NZ. Lake Taupo, on our list of places to visit in the North Island, is in fact an active volcano. What??!

Back on the walking tour we wander through Civic Square with a cleverly suspended silver fern ball at its centre‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and onto Cuba Street with the weirdest fountain ever. A series of tipping buckets splash water from one to the next soaking everything within 10 metres of it. The pedestrianized area was drenched in water and everyone walking towards it looked suddenly very strange as they swerved to avoid the area.

Spotting a bar called Bristol Hotel we felt obliged to pop in for a pint of the old Mac‚Äôs Gold. Although very busy, it unfortunately had that ‚ÄúWetherspoons‚Äù feel of cheap decor and even cheaper nastier food. I shouldn‚Äôt really comment on the food as I didn‚Äôt eat any and the beer did taste OK. But it just had that vibe. Sounding very snobby now. Far to snobby for a traveller who needs to be saving her money. 

Speaking of pinching the pennies, we ventured further into Wellington along Courteney Place and spotted a bar selling $5 pizzas until 7pm. It was 6:58 so we rushed in and ordered two immediately. Result cheap pizza. Felt compelled to order two beers too (well you have to don‚Äôt you). We‚Äôd fallen into the trendy bar trap. Cheap food, expensive beer. Bugger. Good job that darn pizza was tasty.

We resisted temptation to have any more beers and strolled along the waterfront back to our house on wheels. Wellington looks very cool at night reflected in the sea and the harbourside is one of those well-designed developed areas with arty landscaping and trendy warehouse bars. And reminiscent of home.

This is one place we could definitely stay in for a while.
