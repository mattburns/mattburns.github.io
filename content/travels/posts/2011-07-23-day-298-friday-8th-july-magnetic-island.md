Greyhound were in our bad books. We dragged ourselves out of bed whilst it was still dark to get the 7am bus so that we could get out of Airlie Beach and to Magnetic Island as soon as possible. 

Instead we had to wait in a carpark, watching the sun rise, which admittedly was pretty, for an extra hour and ten minutes.

There was no apology or explanation when it finally arrived. Matt had to ask the driver what had happened. Apparently the brake lights on the trailer it was pulling had failed in the middle of the night. Grrr.

Then somehow we were delayed even more enroute and arrived at ferry terminal in Townsville at 13:00, 5 mins after the ferry. Bigger grrr. So had another hour and 15mins sat in a waiting room. Double GRRRR.

After deep breaths we calmed down and were on our way to Magnetic Island.

We are staying at Bungalow Bay in Horseshoe bay. The bay itself is gorgeous. Another calm infinity pool. The accommodation is also very lovely (shame about the staff but that’s a long and boring story to do with wrong pizza orders). We have a triangular wooden hut with a Japanese style futon bed surrounded by trees and wildlife. As we went back to the hut later in the evening we heard something in the bushes and suddenly two rock wallabies came bouncing by, looked at us, then bounced off into the darkness. We could hear them moving around the hut now and again through the night.
