Bloomin’ ‘eck today was hot. Another partial downside is the temperature. Being so close to the equator it is very hot all day long. Even at midnight it is still very warm. So air-conditioning is everywhere, even outside cooling the streets in some places. A big waste of energy and very environmentally **un**friendly.

Visited Chinatown. The cleanest Chinatown I’ve ever been to. Very delicious food (dumpling soup and char siew wonton noodles) and cheapish beer compared to the rest of Singapore.

A 15min walk from Chinatown is Clarke Quay, a very modern waterfront area with multi-coloured bars & restaurants and aforementioned external aircon machines.

Ended back at the harbourside just in time to witness a magic show with Singapore’s very own JC Sim & Magic Babe Ming! They made 5 random people disappear in front of our very eyes. Amazing. Cough, cough. 

[5 people went inside…<img title="5 people inside??" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: block; border-left-width: 0px; float: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-right-width: 0px" height="480" alt="5 people inside??" src="http://www.mattburns.co.uk/travels/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/P1030422_thumb.jpg" width="360" border="0" />][4]

[Da Daah! Oooh where did they go??<img title="ooh where did they go?" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: block; border-left-width: 0px; float: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-right-width: 0px" height="480" alt="ooh where did they go?" src="http://www.mattburns.co.uk/travels/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/P1030424_thumb.jpg" width="360" border="0" />][5]&nbsp;

View of Marina Bay Sands from a different angle:<img title="P1030433" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: block; border-left-width: 0px; float: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-right-width: 0px" height="480" alt="P1030433" src="http://www.mattburns.co.uk/travels/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/P1030433_thumb.jpg" width="640" border="0" />

Wandered across the very cool helix bridge to see if we could get up to the top of the Marina Bay Sands. Nope. Well we could but it cost a tenner each just to get in the lift & the swimming pool is for residents only and as we are being frugal travellers we wandered around inside mall for a bit eyeing up the Jimmys & Manolos from afar (I’ve never seen a pair in real life before, just heard them mentioned on Sex In the City) and wandered back to our cheap accommodation in our scruffy baggy trousers and faded tatty tops. 

Of course no city tour is complete without a visit to the classy establishment that is McDonalds. Matt went for the Mega Mac meal. A double big mac. Tasted the same. Just had twice as many dodgy burgers. Yum. And sadly we felt much more at home than we would have done at the top of Marina Sands Bay.
