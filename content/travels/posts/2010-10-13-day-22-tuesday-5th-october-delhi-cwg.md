Our first experience of a sleeper train was pretty good. We’d booked far enough in advance to get the side upper and side lower beds in a 3AC carriage which meant we could sit opposite each other and go to bed whenever we wanted without worrying about anyone else.

It was an 18 hr journey but didn’t feel like it as from 21.30 til 7.30 we were pretty much sleeping. The evening was occupied with reading and interruptions of “chai, chai chai”, “coffee, nescafe, coffee” etc. And we were even served an evening meal. It was kind of like airplane food. A thali consisting of different runny concoctions, raita and chapati served in separate cartons in a cardboard box. It was tasty enough for 45 rupees.
  
The only downside of the sleeper is sharing the carriage with 62 other people and the chances of there being an extremely good snorer amongst that number of people is pretty high. The chances of them being in the bed next to us not so high but there he was somehow sleeping through his 140dB of snorting which the earplugs struggled to muffle. But despite that with the gentle rocking of the train running at 10mph we were lulled into some kind of sleep like babies in a cot.

Unfortunately reality hit when we arrived at New Delhi train station. Oops sorry Old Delhi train station. Bloomin typical. We’d booked accommodation specifically near New Delhi train station and ended up somewhere else! So it meant fighting tooth and nail to get a fair price for a tuk-tuk to Paharganj where our hotel was. It took “discussions” with about 10 tuk-tuk drivers who ranged from 150 rupees down to 100 and we knew darn well it wouldn’t cost that much. But because of the CWG they’d craftily inflated their prices. Eventually someone gave in and took us on the meter which turned out to be 70 ruppes (although that was still a bit of a con cos the meter said 35. something to do with 2 people or number of kilometres or something. I couldn’t be arsed to argue with the man. It was hot by then and we needed a shower. Also a poor homeless kid was grabbing my arm. And although I wanted to get away from him as soon as possible I felt bad for not helping him. He looked completely zonked out and had some hair missing with a huge scar on his head. It’s terrible the amount of begging children you see here. I don’t know what to do to help.

This area of Delhi is called Pahar Ganj and is the budget accommodation area. It was cordoned off with security at either end so was relatively pedestrianised which was nice. We passed many tourists & travellers along the road which was complete contrast to the last area we stayed in. Lots of cafes and shops and touts.

Found Smyle Inn down at winding sidestreet of Pahar Ganj (which reminded us of the old underground streets of Edinburgh) and they’d managed to somehow overbook themsleves. Even though we’d again booked in advance knowing it would be busy due to the CWG. The guy was full of apologies and sent us to the hotel next door. His friend’s place. Good place yes. Only one night yes. Ok we agreed we understand. So he ployed us with free water and loo roll and off we went to Hotel Unique International (HUI) next door. Hmmm unique it certainly was. No windows and an A/C shaft going up the middle of the building which wasn’t sealed in so we could hear everything in all rooms. Who was chatting, who was showering, that the reception guys were watching Who wants to be a millionaire (a favourite all over India we’ve found) plus the birds nesting in the rooftop. There was also a distinct odour de urine so we quickly bought some incense sticks.
  
We thought 1 night will be fine. We’ll move tomorrow.
