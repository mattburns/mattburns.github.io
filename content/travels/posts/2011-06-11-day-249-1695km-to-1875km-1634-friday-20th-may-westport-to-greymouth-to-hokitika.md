Miserable weather today. Drizzling and grey. It’s like being back in the UK. The weather cannot make up its mind. Except that, unlike the UK in winter, when it’s sunny it’s hot.

1696 to 1824km Westport to Greymouth

Drove to Cape Foulwind where you can walk 4km to the Seal Colony. Ambled to a boring lighthouse and back which took us at least 10 mins and watched some what we thought might be Kiwis (type: bird) but are in fact Wekas (_have more recently found out that Kiwis are really rare_) fighting over bread I threw for them.

The seal colony was cool. As Matt puts it – much better seeing them in the wild than in a zoo. There were so many lazing around of all ages sheltered from the winds and lashing waves by the rocks. The baby ones are so cute!

Next stop on this windy rainy day was Punakaiki for the pancake rocks and blowholes. Unusual shaped rocks eroded by the thrashing waves. It was pretty cool to watch and hear the water crash against the stone at such a force it would spray up through the earth.

What better thing to do on a rainy day than another brewery stop. The second in as many days. This time Montieth’s brewery tour and it was a little disappointing. They no longer brew beer there (as I had thought on day 237), just cider as it’s moved to their main factory in Timaru. So most of the factory was deserted. They’re also moving the cider production soon so they can close Greymouth down to revamp the whole place and reopen it with more sophisticated, automated production of fruit beers.

Still we got to try 8 beers. Golden Lager is still a favourite of mine but quite liked the seasonal Fruit Harvest. Matt was keen on the Pilsner and neither of us liked the Black Lager as much as we thought we would. West Coast Brewing Co wins that one. So no beer was purchased today. Not sure it would have fitted in the fridge.

1825 to 1875km Greymouth to Hokitika (Lake Mahinapua campsite)

Instead of staying in Greymouth we decided to go straight on to a DOC campsite just south of Hokitika. 

We discovered an interesting economical solution to having a separate train bridge and road bridge. Why not have two-in-one? One car/train carriage wide. With a cage covering the entire bridge? And it being dark added to the feeling of being in a suicidal scary movie.&nbsp; The signs said drive slowly. Matt drove as fast as possible. [_Having worked with engineers and watched the news, I don’t trust train signal systems. Driving on a train track with no way to dodge an oncoming train was something I didn’t want to prolong. -Ed_]

Now parked in a field possibly next to a lake we have no idea what it looks like as it’s pitch black.
