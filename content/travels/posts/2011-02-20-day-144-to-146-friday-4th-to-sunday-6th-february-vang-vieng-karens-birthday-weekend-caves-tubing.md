Today changed our opinion of Vang Vieng. We saw a different side to it. 

No teaching so we had the whole day to ourselves. After a good-lie in and a chilled out brekkie lounging on raised platforms overlooking the Nam Song river and the karsts beyond, we took the moped for a drive across the countryside. And I mean across it. There aren’t many roads the other side of the river and to get to many of the “sightseeing” places such as caves and viewpoints you need to go across farmland, dodging chickens and cows and rocks and streams.

The first stop was a cave that a young boy on his bicycle guided us to through woodland and across fields (yes he was cycling as fast as us) to a cave where another young lad was sitting asking for 10k each to go in the cave. We were looking for a lagoon so we turned back and found our way across more random land (with some hiccups where we almost toppled) to a small shelter next to some pools of water and a fantastic backdrop of cliffs. The pools were not for swimming but we paid our 10k there and were guided to another pool with a step ladder for climbing up and jumping off. It didn’t look the clearest water we’d seen so put it off til after the caves.

Well the first cave was beautiful but gave me the jitters. I’m not good with small confined spaces and the further we went in the more I wanted to leave. The crux was when the boy said “look spider!”. We shone our torches above our heads and sure enough this 8-legged monster was sat perched on a stalactite. OK it may not have been a tarantula but it was near enough. The boy said photo? No thanks where’s the exit? As we made our way through smaller gaps he kindly pointed out another spider to Matt. That was it I wasn’t even looking at that one, I was getting out of there pretty pronto.

We didn’t bother with the 2nd cave but the 3rd one had the promised lagoon inside. Hmmm. It was extremely pokey. I saw as much as I wanted to see and let matt carry on down to the “lagoon”. It was a tiny, perfectly still, ice cold pool of crystal clear water. With one fish in it.

Climbed up to viewpoint with panoramic views over Vang Vieng. I say climbed because it was literally scaling limestones rocks and bamboo ladders in flip flops.

As my birthday is Monday and I am teaching we adopted Saturday 5th February as Karen’s drinking birthday. This involved going “Tubing”. Described as a relaxing trip 4km down the Nam Song river on an inner tube quickly turns into a complete mess if you’re not careful. Which of course we weren’t.

A tuk tuk drops you off up river from Vang Vieng (not far from The Organic Farm) and you walk 10 mins up river (to pretty much the Organic Farm) to the start of the bars that are packed along the side of the river. 

We stopped at Fluid bar to grab a beer for the walk up to the tubing start. Beerlao in one hand, tube in the other we followed a narrow footpath avoiding cows as we went.

The first bar was packed and had the obligatory swing over the river. Which we both did in order to get the getting wet over and done with in one go.

After tootling down the river about 100m we were then towed in by another bar. They throw plastic bottles on the end of ropes to catch you.

3rd bar was a whiskey bucket bar. Matt did another swing into the river.

Things started going downhill from here. It was about 4pm by now and someone said there was no way we’d get down the river before dark so just had to do a couple more bars nearby which included fluorescent body paint and get a tuk tuk back. Needless to say we didn’t get our tubes back to town. 

The rest of the evening is a bit of a blur. We definitely had boiling hot pizza as my mouth burned for days after and we went to a club. Basically encouraging the hedonistic side of Vang Vieng. I am such a hypocrite. 

Had nightmare hangovers on Sunday and so spent most of the day watching Family Guy in one of the tacky TV bars!
