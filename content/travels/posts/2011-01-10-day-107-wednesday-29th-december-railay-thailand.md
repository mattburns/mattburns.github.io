Checked out of bland Harmony House at 10:35 and legged it to the main port of Koh Phi Phi nabbing a ticket on the way to catch the 11am ferry to Krabi and “free transfer” to Ao Nang. Intention was to check out Ao Nang and then go onto Railay. Settled down on a ledge at the back of the ferry alfresco and watched beautiful angelfish darting around the coral attached to the jetty. Why fish want to hang around large ferries with their engines blasting and amongst fag butts is beyond me.

One and a half hours later we pulled up at Krabi to find the free bus actually cost 100Baht each. Accosted by a taxi driver who said he could get us to Railay quicker and for the same price (after bartering and 10mins umming & ahhing) we naively agreed. Once in the car we were like hang on a minute didn’t we want to go to Ao Nang first anyway? Doh. Oh well a half hour wait at the new local longtail stop “Nammao” or something like that south of Krabi and we were piled ungraciously into a longtail boat after a wade into a foot of water with a holidaying couple who said Railay was no where near as nice as the islands and they were getting out as quickly as possible to go to Ko Lanta. Great, we thought, we have picked the worst place to spend New Year!

Well apart from that initial obstacle of getting to Railay & being put off, we realised quite quickly that we should ignore that couple altogether as we love Railay. It has the best of all worlds. 

The only way to get to Railay is by boat. Even though it is part of the mainland it is cut off from everything by massive limestone rocks which are more awe-inspiring that Ko Phi Phi. There are 4 main beaches. Railay East is the backpackers side and not for sunbathing but has cool bars and cafes, cheap local eats and a good vibe. A 5 min walk took us to the opposite beach at Railay West which is exactly like Ao Lam Dam on Phi Phi except a bit more upmarket. There is Phra Nang beach which is beautiful and Ton Sai beach that is more rocky but good for rock climbers.

Sorry sounding liking a travel guide now so won’t go on too much longer. (SORRY I LIED)

Our accommodation may not be the best we’ve had. We’re at Railay Cabana which is the furthest point from anywhere in East Railay but the setting is gorgeous. Surrounded by more limestone rocks, we are in a basic bamboo bungalow on stilts with a balcony overlooking all kinds of plants and trees and we believe we can hear gibbons calling in the distance.

It has a couple of downsides. 

The reggae bar on-site opens at 5pm and doesn’t shut til the last person leaves which is fine if you like hearing reggae at extreme volumes til 2 in the morning. 

The hut is maybe a bit too basic. The steps up to the door are overly steep. I thought I was going to keel over backwards when trying to climb up with my backpack on! Also we didn’t notice at first glance but after using the loo and going to wash my hands I realised there was a mirror on the wall but no hand basin. All bucket-filling loo flushing (a lot of places around here have “smooth” loos with no flush – just a bucket and jug) and hand-washing to be done by the same tap. Interesting. Also the wooden floorboards have pretty large gaps in between and there are a number of purpose-made holes in the walls so who knows what could get into the room….

…later that evening, after spontaneously booking half a day rock-climbing at 9.55pm for tomorrow at 9am we got back to the hut to find a room-mate or two. Simon the Spider the size of my hand and his best-mate Colin the Cockroach were sat just inside the door. Colin ran in one direction as i sprinted in the other down the dark steps to the main path to leave Matt and Simon having a stand-off. Luckily Matt won by promptly sweeping Simon out the door before he had chance to join Colin under the bed. Can’t say I was too impressed and decided there and then to look for other accommodation tomorrow.

Matt checked over the rest of the room for any other uninvited visitors and we leapt into bed under the mossie net. Matt fell asleep but I read for another hour until my heart stopped pounding out of my chest and I could relax, when I moved to get into my sleepsheet and Colin’s cousin Clive scuttled across the bed and up the mossie net. I started shouting and Matt jumped up half awake and we both tried to get this bloody thing out of the bed but the mossie net was so securely tucked in to keep out invaders it was difficult to get the sneaky guy out of the darn thing! It was like a carry-on film or something. Definitely moving tomorrow.
