Had a lovely Valentine’s Day in Vientiane. Moved hotels next door to Mixay Paradise Guest House so now we have a cleaner, more modern room with big windows and views over the temple and brekkie included (heart shaped fried-eggs, toast and curry). Although today’s wasn’t too bad as I had American style pancakes with crispy bacon which I thought I was putting maple syrup on but turned out it to be soya sauce. Easy mistake to make. I forgot we’re in Laos and not the USA.

Didn’t do a lot else all day and had a good Chinese meal not far from the hotel. We managed to order 3 times the amount we actually needed to and there were a few giggles from the staff but we managed to munch our way through it. Haha to them! 

Tuesday was a wandering day for us and we found the Laos version of the Arc de Triomphe called Patuxai which is a bit of an eyesore but cost only 3000kip to get in and walk right to the top with panoramic views over Vientiane. Each level was also filled with market stalls of souvenirs. Only in Laos…

I am now having a memory block so no more waffling from me today as I can’t remember anything else we did!
