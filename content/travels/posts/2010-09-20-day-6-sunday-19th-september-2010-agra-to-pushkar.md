Agra was a relief from Delhi as it wasn’t as hectic but it was very touristy and the tuk tuk drivers were there to get as much as poss out of you.
  
Except perhaps our last guy Ahmed who arrived at our door at 4am to take us to the train station for our 5.10 train to Ajmer.
  
This time we chose A/C Chair car so it was like being on a plane, not the comfiest to sleep in but we managed a few hours.
  
I also tried the Indian toilet for the first time – a pretty mean challenge on a moving train. Matt then came back from the loo to inform me that he’d found the western loo. Haha Karen. 

6 hours 40 mins later we arrive in Ajmer to a suffocating heat and a suffocating crowd of tuk-tuk drivers. They’re bloody everywhere!!
  
We had to take one to the bus station to get the bus to Pushkar.
  
the bus was manic, no change there. we piled on with our backpacks squaashing into the last standing gap before the bus pulled away.
  
most people got off at a market 10 mins away so we were able to get a seat and be more comfortable whilst the bus made it’s way up and down the twisty roads of Snake Mountain to Pushkar.

straightaway Pushkar had a different feel. friendlier and more relaxed. it’s a spiritual Hindi town with strict vegetarianism, no alcohol and no embracing or kissing in public.
  
Smoking is fine though.

this time we had no accommodation booked in advance so we joined two belgian students who were headed for a hotel by the lake. the room they looked at was pretty impressive as it was out of a roof terrace the lake seemingly on 3 sides.
  
only problem was the bathroom was shared and across the terrace! the entrance to the hotel was also next to the public loos. not for the faint-hearted, especially as they are doorless.
  
we parted ways then as they headed for a mid-range hotel (this being their last week before heading home to uni) and we wanted something more budget.
  
found Hotel Sanjay on the main shopping street called Sadar Bazaar. I was concerned because it was so cheap. 200 rupees per night (about £2.50) when we’d been paying 3 times that in Agra and 7 times it in Delhi.
  
But we thought we’d give it a go. 

It’s an interesting place. There is no u-bend on the sink. The pipe goes from the plug-hole onto the floor to flow across to the drain.
  
The toilet only flushes once you turn a tap to fill up the cistern.
  
And there is a huge speaker on a plastic chair on the balcony.
  
The rooftop “restaurant” has amazing views on 3 sides of the lake and at sunnset we sat drinking cinnamon black tea and banana lassi (4 out of 5) listening to the drums and the chants of the pilgrims as they walked towards the ghats in their brightly coloured saris.
  
At sunset they bathed in the water and left very quickly. The multi-coloured lights came on around town including the red fairy lights in the Sanjay rooftop restaurant together with the Hindi music.
  
And as Matt and I sat there eating veg thali and listening to Amazing Grace in Hindi remix together with “Hare Krishna” chants, we felt so chilled out. More than in a very long time.

I think we’ll be staying here a few days.
