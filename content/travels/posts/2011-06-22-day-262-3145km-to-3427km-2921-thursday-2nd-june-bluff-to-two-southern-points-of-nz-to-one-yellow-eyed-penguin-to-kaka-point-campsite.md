Matt invented a game to stop the driving boredom – beep the sheep. Every field of sheep we went past he would slow down and beep his horn. Very irresponsible but pretty funny as all sheep in the vicinity would perk their heads up in fear and then leg it. It doesn’t work as well for cows. They just don’t care enough for beeping and carry on chewing the cud.

Today we planned to drive to Dunedin but plans are made to be changed. 

3145 to 3184 Invercargill to Bluff

Headed to the “Land’s End” of NZ called Stirling Point. Had one of those weird small world occurrences when you bump into someone you’ve met before. An Argentinian guy who did the bungy jump the same day as us was stood under the sign with his two mates. 

Got the obligatory photo under the sign.

Also popped up the very steep Bluff Hill to the lookout which was actually quite impressive. Could see the length of Stewart Island in the distance and a very long coastal view. 

3185 to 3308 Bluff to Slope Point

Continued on the Southern scenic route and next stop was the actual most southern point in NZ south island called Slope Point. A boring journey up and down gravel road reached a pull-in for the van and a 15min tramp across swampy fields took us to this stunted sign. Simple. Closest point we have ever been to the South Pole and it’s still bloody miles away!!

3309 to 3324 Slope Point to Porpoise Bay

More boring landscape to Porpoise Bay except for the sloping trees, a glimpse at Niagara Falls (tiniest waterfall ever) and an interesting stop for lunch on top of a cliff edge with sea either side.

3325 to 3427 Porpoise Bay to Nugget Point to Kaka Point

The road improved and it was a mixture of Welsh hills and valleys and rainforest. Couldn’t pass this without stopping for a pic for nan:

We saw our first wild penguin. Whilst we stood poised in our viewing hut at Nugget Point gradually freezing as the sun faded and we were just about to give up hope, a single yellow-eyed penguin appeared in the waves, swam up to the beach, stood up, swam back out a little way (possibly scared by the stupid woman stood on the beach) then waddled out and up the beach hopping into the vegetation. So cute.
