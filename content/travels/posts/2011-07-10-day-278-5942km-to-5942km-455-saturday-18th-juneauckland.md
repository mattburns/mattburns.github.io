Feeling pretty hanging today after all that red wine. 

Isla & Neil were excellent tour guides despite the headaches. Took us to Muahai to see the gannet colony, unfortunately this was the only time of the year when there were no gannets. Almost got washed away when an surprise wave covered us.

Next stop Auckland Museum where we had to put on our best Kiwi accents to get an Aucklander free entry sticker followed by a stroll along Mission Bay & a drive around Auckland city centre.

Then a ferry across to Devonport which reminded me of Richmond. Upmarket shops and alfresco dining. It was time for hair of the dog.

After such a busy day after the night before we were all spaced out and were tucked up in our beds by 11pm on a Saturday night.
