Got our backsides in order today and got out of bed and to the bus station in time for the 9am local bus to Pakse. This was the busiest bus we’ve been on so far in Laos. Only 1 mile after starting out there were more people than seats so the plastic stools once again came out and by the time we arrived in Pakse 5 hours later the aisle was full of people sitting on stools (or the floor and leaning on stools trying to sleep) with at least 4 people standing at the front. We were one of the lucky ones. We had pretty comfy seats and an open window so managed to stay cool enough.

When buses stop it’s normal for women to come to the windows with food and drink for sale. When we stopped for a 10 min loo break it took 9 mins to get off as they all decided to pile on the bus. If you can imagine the amount of people already on this bus and me and a few others trying to get off the bus to find a loo and the aisle filled with plastic stools and women waving meat and eggs on sticks around it was like a Carry On film (again). 

Had our first, and we hope only, experience of blatant tourist extortion in Laos today. At Pakse bus station a guy asked if we wanted a tuk tuk. Yes OK how much. 20,000 kip each. Oh that’s good we thought to go 7km to town. Got onto this empty jumbo tuk tuk and then every single tourist on that bus were piled onto the same tuk tuk. Including two sitting in the front with the driver both holding on for dear life. There were 15 of us and they still expected everyone to pay 20,000 kip each. 300,000 kip is about £25. In my experience that’s a bloody expensive taxi by UK standards. It wouldn’t have been quite so bad (although our 5 hour bus journey was only 40,000 kip each) but then the driver stopped about 1km from the town and demanded we pay up before he took us any further. Of course 15 of us to 1 of him was no match and half of the tuk tuk said they’d been quoted 10,000. So he rings his boss and starts to turn the tuk tuk around. We start shouting at him to stop as we were happy to get out and walk the rest of the way rather than go back to the bloody bus station. In the end he compromised and charged us 15,000 each. None of us could believe that this was happening in Laos. I really hope that’s not a sign of things to come because this country is such a beautiful place and it doesn’t need to overcharge tourists and start putting them off coming here. We’re happy to pay a fair price. 

Anywho, Pakse seems quite soul-less and our hotel is similar but adequate. Found Green Discovery to ask about their Tree Top Explorer trip and it seemed we couldn’t go until Friday so we thought about going somewhere else for a couple of days first. But 10 mins before they shut we went back to check the prices and found that there were two spaces left on the trip for tomorrow so we booked it! $187 each as there are two full groups of 8. Otherwise if there were less than four in the group we would have had to pay extra. Soooo excited!
