Day 3 in Delhi – coincidences

Things improved today. Although we’re still in HUI. We bumped into two girls Abby and Beth (speech therapists from London) who were also off to see the athletics later. Coincidentally (i’m going to say that alot in these blogs) they were in the same block as us. So we travelled together to the stadium and watched the 100m mens and women’s finals.

The women’s was controversial because there was almost a false start because of the noise the crowd were making. An indian shotputter was taking his turn just when the women were getting ready on their blocks. And when an indian athlete did anything the crowds went mental. There was no co-ordination between the field events and track events so this scenario happened quite a few times.
  
Then there really was a false start. And the rule is now if you false start you don’t get another chance. You’re disqualified immediately. The screen looked like the Aussie girl and our girl Laura Turner. But only Laura was identified and she strongly disagreed so ran it anyway. She unfortunately came last then although she should have won it. Instead the Aussie girl won it. And our other English girl Endecott came 4th. Turns out now the Aussie did false start so has been disqualified which moves Endecott to 3rd. But Matt read yesterday that the Nigerian who moved up to gold has failed a drug test so our girl may get a silver in the end!

We also watched the decathlon guys doing the high jump which was pretty cool. The welsh guy got everyone clapping for him and the english guy ended up jumping the highest which was cool.

We left earlier than yesterday so we had a good chance of getting back in time to eat at Sam’s cafe. So we headed there for more pizza with Abby and Beth. Whilst we were sat there a Dutch guy Paul sat at the next table started chatting to us and it transpired he is heading to Varanasi on the 18:30 train tomorrow. Another coincidence.
