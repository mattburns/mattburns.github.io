Feeling a little worse for wear. Our lush view from our campervan was lost on us.

Managed to get enough energy to move to the holiday park in town as we know we want to stay in QT a couple more days.

I’m sure we must still be drunk though as just gone and booked a bungy jump for tomorrow. Arghhh!
