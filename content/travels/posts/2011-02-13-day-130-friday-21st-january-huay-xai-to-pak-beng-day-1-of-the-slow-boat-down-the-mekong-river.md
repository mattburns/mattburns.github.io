Not sure what to write about today. It gave us doubts about travelling. Made us feel old. Well me anyway. And like we’d missed the boat (excuse the pun). Yep we have spent all day on a boat full of young twenty-something travellers.

Got up early so we could have breakfast at 8am in time for the boat pickup at 8.30. Pickup then wasn’t til 9.10. Fine OK no problem. Dropped off at the harbourside with our ticket & boat no. and the 9 of us from BAP Guesthouse traipse onto boat 099 which is filled with old car seats in 2s and 3s. We find our perch and wait. And wait. And wait… 10:30 comes and goes. More people pile on. 11:00. More people arrive. 11:30 still more people. The boat is pretty full to capacity now and we were meant to leave an hour ago. 12:00 and a whole another group comes pouring on. The good old plastic patio chairs come out down the middle of the aisle and by 12:15 we’re packed solid and away.

Can’t say I was in the best of moods by then. Having woken up at 7.15am to get on a boat to sit for 3 hours until it left. Seems that’s the Lao way.

The cruise down the Mekong river to Pak Beng was a long 6 hours but beautiful. The landscape consists of pointed hills, small huts on stilts dotted around or grouped in villages, sandy beaches and large glossy grey rocks protruding from the water. Lots of locals fishing by hand and lots of unguarded fishing rods and nets securely fastened on rocks to avoid being swept away in the fast currents. And every so often a speedboat would pass us in the fast lane to Luang Prabang…

To keep everyone occupied they sold Beerlao, pot noodles and crisps on the boat. Nutritious. And there was the token guitar playing traveller who kept everyone aurally entertained especially the young lassies.

Arriving in Pak Beng it felt like being back in India. Bombarded with guest house touts trying to get to you before you ‘d even got off the boat. I joked to Matt that one would be sat next to us in a moment and 2 mins later one was coming down the side of the seats!

It really doesn’t feel like we’re in the middle of Laos right now though. I don’t know what I expected but we’re on a strip of guesthouses and restaurants and shops that could be Varkala, could be Koh Phi Phi. So touristy. But as Matt says we are tourists. But it’s just too easy. We did go for Lao food tonight to try and make it a bit more authentic. Lap/Larp – minced buffalo with spring onions and ginger, and a beef stew, served with Beerlao in a very lovely place called OuxUan.
