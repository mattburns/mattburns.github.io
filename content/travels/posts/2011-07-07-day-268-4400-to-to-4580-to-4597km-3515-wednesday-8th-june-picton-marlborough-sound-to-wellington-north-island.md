After 5 weeks in the South Island we’re off to the North and the capital of NZ. Right now I’m sat on the Interislander ferry from Picton to Wellington with fabulous views out of the window of Marlborough Sounds. It’s a far better ferry than the ones I remember going on student exchange trips to Germany. I don’t feel seasick for one thing.

Arrived early (for us) in Picton so we could explore Queen Charlotte Drive, the slow winding extremely scenic road with some parts falling into the sea between Picton and Havelock. Just as beautiful as Milford Sound. Parked up with an idyllic view across the Sound behind us to eat our glamorous lunch of fried-egg sarnies & a cup of tea.

We have more or less travelled the entire coastal road of South Island. We only missed Takaka to Collingwood, Westport to Karamea and Haast to Jackson Bay (minus 4km to the petrol station), and the last 10km to Havelock on Queen Charlotte Drive. 

Total distance travelled in South Island: 4580km

Some doomed passengers trying to see the sunset too & possibly wondering why they feel a tad nauseous.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_7537.jpg)

Hot Tip: book the ferry online via Interislander and book a Websaver. We saved $105 off the normal price of a campervan.
