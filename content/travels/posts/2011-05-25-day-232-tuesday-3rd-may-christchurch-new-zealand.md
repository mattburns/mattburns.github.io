Qantas again delivered. Both the Bangkok to Sydney and the Sydney to Christchurch legs were on time and well fed. Had about 6 meals in 12 hours as our clocks turned forward 3 hours then another 2. We’re a total of 11 hours ahead of the UK now so when you’re waking up to eat your cornflakes we’ll be finishing dinner and off to bed.

Look Australia! ![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/05/P1060125.jpg)

Arriving at Christchurch airport customs we were scared into throwing our packet of crisps into the bin. Security is really tight on bringing in food from outside into NZ. They re-scan your bags before you exit the airport. I didn’t want us to be arrested over a packet of Snack Bi-Dos no matter how good they were and how much Matt wanted to eat them.

It was bloody freezing. We knew it would be cooler as it is autumn here but our teeth were chattering. The jackets we bought in Bangkok aren’t going to cut it. 

Boarded a bus into Christchurch and asked for the city centre. The driver kind of half-laughed and said the city’s closed. I can take you to Parkside and that’s as far as I can go. 

We weren’t really sure what he meant. We knew there had been an earthquake in February but we didn’t know how bad it was and the Japanese earthquake had dominated the news since then. You can’t imagine until you get there. We were dropped off at Hagley Park near the hospital and needed to get to the other side of the city centre. Whilst trying to work out the best route a kind passer-by offered some help. He advised which roads weren’t closed and we were on our way. 

I cannot describe well enough how devastated Christchurch is. We walked along Asaph St, a main road about half a mile from Cathedral Square in the centre. Every road in the direction of the centre was cordoned off. Police, the army and barriers blockaded the access to the city. All along Asaph St we saw what an earthquake can do to buildings. Some had broken windows. Some had cracks down the walls. Some had chimneys missing. Some had whole walls missing. An entire row of shops, two storey high buildings, had no fronts left. They looked like smashed up dolls houses. A skyscraper in the centre was tilted.

Every building we passed had an inspection poster pinned to it. Green for OK, yellow for some damage, red for no-go area/condemned. 

It took us 40mins to walk to our hostel on the corner of Barnardoes St & Gloucester St. It was a Tuesday afternoon in major city and we saw hardly any pedestrians and cars. 

Our hostel only opened back up on 2nd May. Luckily they had no structural damage but the whole road had been closed off since the quake. The authorities are trying to sort out Christchurch street by street and reducing the cordoned off area. But so many have just been written off by a 20 second quake.

At the hostel we were are in our first dorm room with other people. Think I’ll sleep fine as am completely spaced out from having half hour sleep in past 2 days.

They have a huge kitchen here, we actually get to cook for ourselves. The closest open supermarkets were 20mins away and on our way we passed a lovely old English-style building with two towers and a green glass dome. The dome was smashed and one of the towers had disintegrated exposing the rooms inside on all 3 levels. There was a crack right down the centre of the building to the lintel above the central doorway. 

Food is expensive here to buy. We had a shock when we saw how much a loaf of bread & 4 pints of milk were. Maybe twice what we pay at home. It’s going to take some getting used to after being in Asia. 

Cooking was bliss though. Sounds vile but a microwave steak pie is lush after weeks of eating noodles and rice. Don’t get me wrong we loved the food in Asia. But sometimes some good old-fashioned stodge is needed. And Matt has got his appetite back at last.

_<09/05/11 just watched a program about the earthquake and saw office buildings that were completely flattened and the TV-NZ building being torn down as it was unsafe. Terrible.>_
