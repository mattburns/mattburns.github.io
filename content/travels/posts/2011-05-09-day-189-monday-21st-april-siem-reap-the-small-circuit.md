5am start to Angkor Wat for sunrise. At that time of the morning Siem Reap is already humming with the sound of tuk-tuks, mopeds and bicycles all heading in one direction.

Making our way along the promenade we were stopped by ticket inspectors with torches before proceeding to join the hoards around the lake at the front of Angkor Wat. We managed to get a good seat on one of the small temples next to the lake and Matt set up his 7D for a timelapse that turned into a time lacks. There was no sunrise. The clouds denied us. A few thousand people all looking to the sky for an hour of black to grey to light grey to white sky. What a disappointment. Darn it!

We continued on our “small circuit tour” to Bayon, one of the most striking and beautiful temples. By then the sun had decided to put in an appearance and the light bounced off the 216 faces giving them a lifelike aura.

Another temple, another steep sweaty climb…![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_4187.jpg)

More trees…

Trying to restore 1000 year old temples is not easy, especially when the crane is too short.

Our final stop was back full-circle at the famous Angkor Wat. Typically we found this temple to be one of the most un-inspiring inside. From outside and afar it is spectacular. But the level of detail of carvings were not as stunning as Banteay Srei or Bayon.

By 1pm we were back at the hotel exhausted. A jam-packed temple tour behind us.

But the tour wasn’t complete without the mini-Angkor version. A long wander along the river to the LP recommended mini-Angkor which a sculptor had made in his garden. Kind of impressive. Kind of not.

Back along the river we observed the reason why the river is un-polluted. Upstream they have installed a netted barrier to stop all of the rubbish. Two sides to Siem Reap. Clean and pruned alongside the Royal residence. Not so pretty further upstream with wooden shack homes over the banks and piles of rubbish being collected by locals in riverboats. Possibly a new way of recycling?

The rains threatened us again and we ducked into a restaurant for 50c beer just in the nick of time. The skies exploded, the lightning cracked, the tuk-tuk drivers threw on their ponchos and battened down the hatches and the rains came and turned dry dusty Siem reap into a flowing river.

Even we had to give in to the tuk-tuks and pay a 1 dollar fee to get back rather than drown in red mud on the walk back to Palm Garden Lodge.
