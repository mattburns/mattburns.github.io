Last day in Darjeeling and weather today is lovely. Khangchendzonga is clearly visible on above the skyline. It’s beautiful.

We stopped at our regular egg roll lady and acquired two on the way to Observatory Hill North East of centre to sit and admire the view of the mountain. Not quite as impressive a view as the one from Sandakphu but still not bad. 

Stopped for tea tasting where the guy let us smell about 20 different samples of tea which he warmed in his palms first to release the aroma. We then tried 2 types with more Cake Lady cake!

Braved the post office. To send a parcel from India it has to be wrapped in white muslin and sealed with wax. So we collected together everything we wanted to send into one bundle and took it to a material shop where an old bloke took a piece of scrap muslin, sewed it into the shape of our parcel, put the parcel inside and then sewed it shut with thick cotton. Anther guy then took out a bar of red wax and a seal and like in the _olden_ days when all letters were sealed with wax, he carefully blobbed wax along the seams and pressed the seal down to fix it. Fascinating. We trotted off to the post office, filled in the customs forms in quadruplicate, wrote the address on the muslin and sent it off into the Indian postal system. Which apparently is more reliable than the British one. We read a newspaper cutting in one shop from a few years back that claimed people from the UK holidaying in India around November/December time would bring their Christmas cards with them and post them. Must say it seems cheaper to send a letter from India than UK. And it was only 12 rupees for a postcard (15p). 

Love Darjeeling. Will yet again be a shame to leave it. But will be good to get to some warmer climes again.
