We decided to stay in Cairns for the rest of the week. As much as we want to see Port Douglas and Cape Tribulation we are running short on funds and want to make the most of Sydney & Japan so we have to compromise.

I won’t bore you with the details (as I have in the 302 days previously) so here’s the overview of Cairns post-diving.

Interesting graffiti & sculpture just off Grafton Street near a kooky little cafe called Caffiend.

Matt & I also had a go at learning to twirl rubber balls on the end of ropes in an organised fashion. Matt got it straight away. It took me a little longer with a lot of patient teaching from one of the fire guys, frizzed up hair, a lot of bruises on legs, arms, head & almost a cracked jaw, and what must have been 2 hours later I finally got it!

By the end of our stint in Cairns we had come to realise how touristy it was. There are many backpacker hostels, tacky bars and expensive seaview restaurants. But beyond the didgeridoo “specialists” and daytrip tours, down the side-alleys and in the nooks and crannies there’s a liveable side to it that’s cute & quirky from cafes to vintage, music, craft & second hand book shops. And a gorgeous free lagoon to use all year round.
