100 days into our adventure and today wasn’t particularly eventful.

In Hat Karon, Phuket and there are “girlie” bars everywhere and lots of middle-aged european men with pretty young Thai ladies on their arm. Or two or three guys sat at a table with one girl. 

The beach is lovely, although mostly covered in sunloungers, we found a spot to lay a towel and sunbathed for half an hour before we could bear the heat no longer and went for a wander around the streets full of souvenier shops, clothes shops and restaurants. Plus a whole row of massage shops. Must have counted at least 8 next to each other. 

Had my first green curry of thailand which was absolutely delicious, watched the sun set over Hat Kata, walked back to Hat Karon via the main road which was a bit suicidal and found the only non-girlie bar called Nakonnai with live music and a pool table and we were absolutely rubbish! Completely out of practice.
