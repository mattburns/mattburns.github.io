Wendy & Steve are coming back today and they’re staying in Khao San Road. Bugger. Ah well it’s not that far from Silom. Maybe 7km.

We aim to get a boat to KSR to meet them but are running late as usual so head over in a taxi. The traffic is a nightmare. It’s peak-time so takes 50mins. By the time we get there they’re already on their 2nd beer. And it goes downhill from then on really. Some strange woman is already entertaining the crowds by wandering around with her shirt half-on half-off. Not pretty.

A couple of drinks on KSR followed by a few drinks and food on Soi Rambutri. We aren’t happy with the size of a pitcher. It barely fills 4 half pints. So we move onto the beer tanks.

Steve & Matt disappear to play pool against a middle-aged Chinese guy who had emigrated to Thailand 30 years ago to make more money (this I find out from him after they’ve played a few games). It starts off with a friendly game then moves onto “I’ll play you left-handed”, then “I’ll play you one-handed left-handed”. Hmmm I think he knows what he’s doing. 

A few hundred Baht down Matt suddenly has hit the beer/pool peak and wins back some money from the guy (who claims his name is Ping Pong). He suddenly looks really upset. I really think he’s going to cry so we leg it (after me trying to persuade Matt to “lose” to let him win some money back) to another bar for another pillar of beer.

Friday is a write-off. We managed to get back to KSR late afternoon to join Wend for some last-minute shopping and the pair of them for a Thai curry. Only after it took us 40 mins to walk to the closest ferry stop then another 20 min ferry journey (which is good for seeing another side of Bangkok, like teeny tug-boats pulling huge massive freighters) and a 10 min walk to KSR.

Then we had to leave as we have to catch an early train in the morning. It was sad leaving. I kind of got used to seeing Wend around and now it will be another 4 months again. I’m sure it’ll fly by though.

We have decided to go back to Siem Reap for 3 weeks as we liked it so much and it’s not too far from Bangkok. Matt wants to spend time working on [www.stolencamerafinder.com][5] before we head to New Zealand and I’m going to try and help out and also look at doing some more volunteering.
