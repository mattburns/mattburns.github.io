Woken up by the sun beaming through the curtains. Dragged Matt out for a run too and he sped off ahead of me uphill to Okiwi lookout. Stunning views of the sea, train track & our little van the only vehicle in the campsite. It was knackering.

Popped across the road to have breakfast with the back doors open over the sea.

The drive back to Kaikoura was a completely different story from the drive out to the campsite. The air was clear and we could see rows of mountains some a little dappled with snow.

Puhi Puhi campsite may have been a different story this morning as we could see the route we’d taken up into the mountains.

Started out on the 2 hour Kaikoura peninsula walk with the sun shining and ended 3 hours 20 mins later with gale force winds, grey misty skies and crabfish fritters by the sea.

There is so much wildlife along this coast. Oystercatchers, herons, seals, cows.

Back at Okiwi Bay campsite in the rain chomping bangers & mash and listening to old skool chillout music. Ah you gotta love Coldplay, Travis and Massive Attack.
