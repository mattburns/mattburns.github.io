Hopped on the 9:20 train back to Sydney and at Central Station were planning on walking to the Harbour Bridge but made a rash decision to get another train leaving in 3 mins to Milson’s Point, the train station the other side of the Harbour bridge, or so we hoped.

The train travelled underground to Town Hall, then to Wyndham and when the voice over the tannoy said “next stop Milson’s Point” and we started slowing down we were still in darkness. We looked at each other and thought where the hell are we going? Suddenly there was light at the end of the tunnel and we popped out at the Harbour Bridge itself. We sat there, the typical tourists, cameras pointing out of both sides of the train to try to get shots of the Opera House at speed.

And turns out Milson’s Point couldn’t be closer to the bridge if it tried. And Luna Park. Although it happened to be closed on weekdays, we wandered by for a nose at the famous gates and funwheel. We really can’t get over how similar Australia is to the UK in so many ways. Although it’s the slightly newer more improved version with added sunshine. The things they tried & tested in the UK were brought over here. (Sorry if I offend anyone, Aussie or British). Like Luna Park being down under’s answer to Blackpool Pleasure Beach but quirkier and cooler.

Unfortunately Luna Park is closed weekdays in the winter so we couldn’t go and play.

But on bright side it is built in one of the best locations in Sydney. Look at the views this giant face gets every day of its existence.

You’re probably wondering how many more angles we can get of the opera house & harbour bridge. Don’t worry, at least two I think.

After a quiet streetside flat white and almost being attacked by one of the skankiest pigeons I’ve ever seen which looked like it had been buried in a tomb and been brought back to life by vampires, we wandered up through Kirribilli which was much more chilled than The Rocks and across the Harbour Bridge.

Reaching the other side we spotted the pillion tower which you&nbsp; can walk up. We’d completely forgotten we’d wanted to do that so we did it. For the $11 entrance fee (which we are sure the guy pocketed as we heard no til open – but don’t want to accuse anyone of anything illegal here), we expected a long tough walk up hundreds of staircases. Instead we were only just getting warmed up when we were out of the viewing balcony. We could see the bridge climbers making their way over the archway strapped to a rail and suddenly $11 for a 5 min walk including lots of information about the bridge on the way up didn’t seem so bad. It was freezing and windy on the balcony here. God knows what it was like for those guys and they’d paid $179 for the luxury of 3hours in those conditions. Especially as it started raining as we came back down. So not having done the bridge climb and having no experience of it for comparison I would definitely recommend the tower over the climb.

Our next recommendation is for lunch at the [Met Centre][13] on George Street. It’s the most upmarket food court we’ve ever been in and after 2pm when the lunch rush is over all of the counters have afternoon specials with up to a third off. We had a pile of sushi and a lemongrass beef baguette for $12.

Our day in Sydney ended with a wander up George Street passing Victorian buildings and through the central shopping area full of modern malls. In the middle of them all was a&nbsp; magnificent building called The Strand. Why they let JB-Hifi open up in the basement is anyone’s guess but the rest of the shops do it justice. It is beautiful.

Jumped on the bus at Hyde Park, grabbed our luggage from Coogee and after two more bus journeys were at Sydney Airport. Finally got around to having a Hungry Jacks (Burger King) which is just want you want before getting on a plane and being fed an evening meal. It had to be done.

The Indonesian volcano didn’t affect our flight to Japan and off we went on our A330 for a 9 hour 15min flight to Narita at the scheduled time of 21:55.

_Sweets for the flight:_![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/10/P1080220.jpg)
