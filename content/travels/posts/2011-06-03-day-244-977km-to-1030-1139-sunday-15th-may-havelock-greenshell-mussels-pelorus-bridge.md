Left Renwick and landed in Havelock 30mins later in the rain so sat at the harbourside until lunchtime watching the clouds pass over the hills and the rainbows fade in and out, in and out.

Lunch at the Mussel Pot for famous huge Havelock greenshell mussels in a blue-cheese sauce and blue-cheese mussel chowder. (Hmm seem to be hooked on blue-cheese?)

Only managed to get a bit further up the road to pitch in Pelorus Bridge, a DOC campsite in the forest. Just about managed a 20min walk to a nearby suspension footbridge and some pratting about on rocks before dark.
