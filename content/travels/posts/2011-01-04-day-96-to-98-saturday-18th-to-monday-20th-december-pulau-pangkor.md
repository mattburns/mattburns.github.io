5 hour bus journey from KL to Lumut further up the coast, caught the last ferry to Pulau Pangkor and arrived at a car park full of baby pink ford rascal minibuses. The taxi dropped us off in Telak Nipah, the most budget bit of the island and we went to our selected B&B to ask for room. Sorry full. Next one. Sorry full. Next one…and so on until we’d exhausted every guest house & hotel in Telak Nipah. Shit. It was Saturday and Pulau Pangkor attracts the locals from the mainland for the weekend. Darn it didn’t think of that did we. Pangkor is a pretty small island, it was dark, and the last ferry back to the mainland had already gone. We had nowhere to stay. We were getting desperate. It must have shown as Matt was offered the sofa in a guy’s office if we couldn’t find anywhere.

Well we did find somewhere eventually at a large hotel in the next village. So back in a pink minibus we jumped, paid the same amount again to get there and paid 5 times our budget for one night! We didn’t care. It was 10pm and we weren’t keen on the sofa idea. And the room was pretty nice. And breakfast buffet was included which was an interesting affair. It reminded me of a school canteen. Masses of people swarming around making a racket. 

Got another pink taxi back to Telak Nipah, found the cheapest accommodation possible at the chilled out reggae themed Nazri Nipah Camp and hit the beach. A lovely curve of sand with pretty blue water. <img title="P1030570" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: block; border-left-width: 0px; float: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-right-width: 0px" height="480" alt="P1030570" src="http://www.mattburns.co.uk/travels/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/P1030570_thumb.jpg" width="640" border="0" />

Shame about the construction going on all along the beach. The local council have decided to build permanent structures for the hawkers to setup in as they think the makeshift corrugated iron and tarpaulin lean-tos further along the beach are unsightly. It’s stupid though because where the stalls are located at the moment doesn’t obscure anyone’s view as there are no hotels or houses opposite them. Where the council are building the new places completely blocks views from all of the beachfront accommodation with names like Seaview that look like they’ve invested a lot of money in their accommodation. Visitors to the area aren’t going to want to pay a premium price for views of concrete buildings. There is also a law that you cannot build within 60feet of the beach but these are directly on the beach. It’s a stupid stupid idea and is surely going to drive tourists away.

There were lots of very tame (and/or hungry) hornbills on the island. A family decided to feed this one some crisps: ![IMG_0076](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_0076.jpg)

But we found out later they prefer banana as we saw these lined up for feeding time.

Monday spent all day trying to work out where to go next. The original plan was to work our way north to Penang and Langkawi in Malaysia and over the border by boat to Ko Lipe in Thailand. But we couldn’t find any accommodation in Langkawi or Ko Lipe around Christmas time. Instead decided to spend Christmas in Ko Lanta near Krabi in Thailand. And insanely thought it would make sense to fly to Phuket and get the boat to Ko Lanta. Not sure that is the best idea we’ve come up with but at least we know where we’re spending Xmas now. Hooray!
