Monday back to school and whilst UK basks in hot sunny weather on a bank holiday we get rain so the cycle there is nice and muddy. It‚Äôs a little like being back at home except it‚Äôs still roasting. 

Aly had some bad news. During the storm on Saturday the lightning had struck everyone‚Äôs homes in the area killing everyone‚Äôs TVs, her stereo, modem and her husband‚Äôs PC. There is a phone mast just next door and so it must have attracted the lightning. In the UK I‚Äôm sure you wouldn‚Äôt see a mast so blatantly close to homes. It‚Äôs ridiculous. Aly is worried about the hazards for the children with the flooding and the play area being metal.&nbsp; It means more fund-raising is needed to make it safe for the coming months as the storms will only worsen.

Tried the hyper drink today. Every break-time the kids run round the back of the school&nbsp; to buy snacks & E number filled refreshments the lady with the ice crusher over the back fence.

Which means after break-time they‚Äôre hyperactive and it‚Äôs usually the best time to play a game as it‚Äôs rare they‚Äôll sit still for more than 5 minutes.

The hyper drink is a plastic cup of crushed-ice with red syrup, some sweet goo & condensed milk over the top eaten with a brightly coloured plastic spoon. The vendor of such delights retrieves a large block of ice from her big ice chiller and grinds it down into shavings on a more sophisticated iron version of Mr. Frosty. It‚Äôs ingenious.

I didn‚Äôt feel too well that evening, so I wonder if it was an overdose of sugar!

&nbsp;

Tuesday was the complete opposite weather wise. It was hot hot hot with clear blue skies. Matt was lovely and cool in our A/C room when I headed out into the heat and started burning up at 9am.

I‚Äôm not sure what happened today. In in the morning class I had one of the youngest kids crying because he was being picked on by an older kid, muddy tears pouring down his cheek and then this afternoon another kid refusing to join in or listen. Maybe it was the heat. I don‚Äôt know if I helped either situation at all. Having some woman babbling to you in a language you don‚Äôt quite understand when you‚Äôre upset can‚Äôt be that good. Both managed to come round and start smiling again thankfully. And Dyna the second boy managed to snap out of it enough to start a game of hangman with me at break-time to distract me from marking the homework. üòÄ

&nbsp;

Wednesday I found a hit of a game. A variation on Boggle which I borrowed from a UK kids website. I wrote a 4 x 5 table of letters on the board including letters of words I had taught this week. They had to try and come up with words using the letters in the table and they got a point for each letter. They started looking at the dictionary and writing words up their arms to get as many as possible. An organised game soon turned to chaos. But hey they were having fun and learning new words!

&nbsp;

Today, was my last day at SHAC and it was sad. Not because my fan design was terrible and one of the kids had to show me how to make a better one. We all made fans because it was stifling hot in the classroom. And not because I managed to lose all of my games of Thumb War, even with the tiniest girl in the class. Even reading a book to them was a hit for once. My earlier attempts of reading had gone down like a ton of bricks. They loved The Snowball and I loved reading it to them. It was sad because they genuinely acted like they didn‚Äôt want me to leave. Although it could have been the sweets I‚Äôd brought in and used as bribes when they behaved themselves üòÄ&nbsp;

I‚Äôd had a few hugs during the past couple weeks but this time I had a massive group hug from eight of the smallest kids in one go. It was so sweet.

After class we had a mass photo of me with all the kids doing the smiling hearts symbol and Christina and Dyna (the boy who had been upset in my class on Tuesday) just didn‚Äôt want to let go. I had to keep the tears back.

Nathaly asked me when was I coming back. I had to truthfully say I didn‚Äôt know but I hope to one day. I really do. I wish I could have stayed longer.

As I left she and Christina brought me the hugest bunches of wild purple flowers that filled the basket on my bike. Just down the road another girl gave me a yellow flower and yet another girl gave me a bunch of leaves.

_Other memories of SHAC_

Throwing a paper ball to start a conversation practice session and hitting a kid on the head with it straightaway.

Buying the SHAC volunteer T-shirt and wearing it with pride, really feeling part of it.

Being welcomed by Aly and her family so openly and fully.

Getting lots of high fives.

The natural generosity of the kids. Earlier this week I was humbled by one of the girls giving me a packet of Snack Bi-Do (like Skips) as a present. She‚Äôs a bit of a tomboy and always comes to school with mud on her face and appears very poor. 

Matt became addicted to them so I queued up with the kids at the local shop to buy in bulk.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/05/P1060094.jpg)

I‚Äôd been given a packet of dried peas by the girl who beat me at Thumb Wars and postcards of Angkor Wat by another girl who had only been in my class twice. I assumed she‚Äôd been away with her family for Khmer New Year.

My journey to and from SHAC. Each day I became more familiar to the people I passed and so would get hellos from different people. And lots of ‚Äúhello teacher‚Äù. Especially at one of the small communes where Aly told me 9 families lived in a number of wooden houses. They‚Äôd had no toilet until she managed to get the money together and had recently built two toilets inside the commune. As I passed on my last day leaving SHAC the tiny children who normally shout out came running out to say hello to me. They couldn‚Äôt have been more than 3 years old. All five of them were barely dressed and had muddy blotches here and there but all five of them were beaming with the biggest grins. I put my hand out to them and they all started holding my hand. It was such a lovely experience. I would like to have a photo to share that moment with everyone but I didn‚Äôt want to get my camera out and ruin the moment. Instead I have that wonderful unspoilt memory to myself. 

Another striking experience happened moments after as I got off my bike to avoid some pot-holes just as a young boy came out of his house. He was smiling at me so I said ‚Äúhigh 5‚Äù and as I put my hand up he flinched away. I lowered my hand so he could clap it and then tried high-5 again and he did it and grinned. I was so relieved. It shocked me that his first reaction was that I was going to hit him. It seems that happens a lot here.
