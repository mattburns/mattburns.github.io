Happy 1st Anniversary to John & Kelly Wass! Can’t believe it’s been a whole year since your wedding. Time has flown. Miss you guys lots!

Our last day of diving today. It rained all night long heaviest we’d heard and was still raining at 6am when the alarm went off. But by the time we boarded Hammerhead the blue sky was winning and Matt has his first sunburn of the Andaman Islands.

We didn’t quite realise whilst sat on the boat in our “shortie” wetsuits quite how strong the sun was. So both of us have _really_&nbsp; attractive sunburn marks just above the knees.

We were taken on a 90min boat ride to South Bottom dive point which was a small island surrounded by reef so had a longer day with much chilling on the boat whilst passing acres of mangroves. And Matt was able to take the camera – hooray! He got some really good photos which I’ll make sure he puts here. Saw a lot of the same fish as before plus&nbsp; a crocodile fish lying in the sand and some red striped clown fish.

Only 2 proper days left on Havelock. Sad times. Please sun keep shining….
