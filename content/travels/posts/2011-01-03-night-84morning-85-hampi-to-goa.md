…30 mins after leaving Hospet, we stopped at a service station. All traipsed off to the loo shack where of course only 1 out of the 3 loos was unlocked. I was next in the queue and there was a powercut. Everywhere went pitch black. I didn’t quite think I could bring myself to pee in the dark when you can’t see where you’re putting your feet so trotted back too get the torch (little did I know…see later that night).

Half hour later we were back on the road and although it wasn’t yet 8pm we decided to get some sleep. When the bus wasn’t moving it was the most comfortable bus in the world. When it was moving you could feel every bump and hear every screech of the brakes and feel every sleeping policeman.

Still managed to snooze until about 11pm when I woke and thought wonder if we’ll stop for a break soon. Nope. Nada. An hour later still going…an hour more we finally pull up. It’s 1am. As anyone that knows me well will know after 6hours of travel I am in desperate need for a comfort stop. So I leg it off the bus to find we’re parked on the side of a road next to some street vendors and some trees. I look for the public loos. None in sight. I see guys doing what they do at the side of the road and ask the driver where do I go? He grunts and points in the direction of the trees. Fantabulous. OK so us girls have to wander off into the darkness in the middle of the night down the side of a grassy bank with rubbish all around to find our own bush to pee behind. Brill. I stopped worrying about where I was putting my feet.

Just over 3 hours later we pull up in Margao. What??? It’s 4.30am. The guy told us it was a 12hr trip. What do you do when you arrive in the middle of the night? Camp out at the 24hr Nescafe cafe that’s what. What a lifesaver. Cappuccinos and cheese & tomato toasties kept us going til 7.30 when we called Margao Residency to see if we could check in early. Yes come now they said…
