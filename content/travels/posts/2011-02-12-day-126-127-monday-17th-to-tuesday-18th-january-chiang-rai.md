The longtail trip down the Mae Nam Kok river (a tributary of the Mae Kong (Mekong) river) was a lovely way of getting to Chiang Rai from the sleepy town of Thaton. It took 3.5 hours including a 20min loo/coffee stop with the most expensive coffee ever. 50THB for half a cup of “Americano”. If we’d gone for Nescafe we would have saved ourselves 30THB per cup! At the pitstop there was also a guy holding a huge great long python saying “photo, photo”. Hmmm didn’t really fancy that thanks. Unfortunately there were a number of cages there with different sized snakes in. All snoozing away ready to be man-handled for a photo opportunity.

Very gorgeous scenery. It reminded me of southern Thailand with limestone rocks looming over the river. And we saw elephants! Amazing creatures.

Although some didn’t seem to have tusks.

Most of the journey was calm but for a couple of times when we all had to sit in the centre of the boat to go through the rapids. The first time Matt was soaked by a wave and the second time it was my turn. No-one came out at the other end of the journey unscathed.

We met a guy called Mark on the boat who was from a small place in the UK known as Bristol. It was good to talk to someone that was so familiar with the places we know and that had the same appetite for beer as us so we ended up in a bar in Chiang Rai for the rest of the day. 

Mark had been in Australia and so was able to give us advice about where to go and funnily enough he is off to India next so we were able to offload lots of useless information onto him about what to expect. 

Not sure what to think of Chiang Rai. I don’t know if it’s just the part of town we’re staying in but it is reminiscent of Phuket. Lots of middle-aged men drinking in bars with young Thai girls. Why oh why oh why??

On Tuesday we moved from the Tourist Inn as the room was depressing and even the shower was rusty (the white plastic was now brown) so the water stank. 

Bamboo House is a much nicer place. Little cute clean bungalows and free coffee (always a bonus for us). Still there is one tall European guy staying here with a ladyboy companion. Whatever floats your boat.

Wandered round Chiang Rai, found the market and bought some streetfood to eat for lunch by the river. Instant KFC and corn on the cob. 

There are speakers in the streets here and from morning to night there is a guy talking about something in Thai. Not sure if it’s religious or political. Plus you can hear music or some kind of religious chanting at 7am. No lie-ins for us.

Not much else to say about Chiang Rai. It’s nice enough. It has a quirky library made from an old train:

And a nice temple Wat Jethod:

And has a lovely little night market selling usual farang souvenirs and clothes and in the square next to it there are a number of independent shops selling unique products. Intricate word carvings, funky hand-decorated trainers and gorgeous silver rings with collections of stones on. It’s a shame none of those fit properly otherwise I’d have blown the budget :)
