Guess who we bumped onto last night? Isla & Neil. It was inevitable as we’ve been in Varkala over a week now. We’re not very good at this “travelling” lark are we. (We blame the railway system!) They’d been here since Sunday and lucky for them had avoided us for 2 days. We have arranged to meet up with them later for dinner. Our last night in Varkala before we head to Alleppey. Getting a rickshaw at 6am tomorrow so must remember not to drink so much!

Just eaten lunch at Rani’s again. This time she was overflowing with guests so we had our own private dining table on one of the verandas. Matt was disappointed not to be eating with Mummy again. I think he wants someone else to talk to other than me. Hence the addiction to literature. Lucky we’re off out with Isla & Neil later to give him some stimulating conversation. We’re both feeling the same really. It’s good to chat to other people and we had that a lot in the rest of India but Kerala is more of a holiday destination rather than backpacking so not so easy to mingle.

Rani laid on another luscious feast. The best mussels I have tasted, spicy small fish which could have been whitebait (she didn’t elaborate on what they were – “it’s fish”), fish curry, red onions in raita, veggies, rice and poppadums. Delish. No spoons this time. We ate it properly with our hands.

Had my 5th and last yoga class with Santhosh @ Kasi Yoga and could definitely tell the difference. I can actually properly hold my feet now! Aren’t you impressed? I really need to carry it on too. Apparently if I do 15 mins everyday of the “Stand Salute” or 1 hour of postures 4 to 5 times a week I’ll be super bendy in no time. 

Whilst I was yoga-ing, Matt was out taking photos and papped the lady shopkeeper whom we passed everyday and persistently asked me to look in her shop and try things on and buy which I did and did and did on about the 4th day. After that she didn’t try to sell me anything again but would say hi every time we passed and have a chat about what we were up to. Then today she had bought in new stock and she wanted me to look but we had no time so unfortunately I didn’t get chance. But Matt has promised to send her the photos of her so I hope she’ll be pleased with those.

Met up with Neil & Isla for cocktails and food. It was Matt’s turn to eat an insane reproduction of a continental dish. This time the Risotto.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seafood pasta sauce and a spoonful of basmati rice on top. Interesting combination. It was edible at least though unlike the aubergine gratin in Jodphur. The four of us are heading in similar directions again – Hampi & Goa – so we’re sure to cross paths again.

I have just realised we have been away for 10 weeks now. Where does the time go? How easy it is to do nothing in particular for weeks on end. And even without TV most of the time and no Jeremy Kyle.
