Whilst having our breakfast overlooking the lake we were suddenly surrounded by cars. What is going on? We are in the middle of nowhere again but all these people are turning up and getting out of their cars with their thermos‚Äô to have a natter. It finally dawns on us they are most probably here for some memorial as almost all of them are wearing black. And there we are munching on toast with the radio blaring out Katy Perry & Lady Gaga.

Even the swans wore black.

2 hour drive took us from Napier to Taup≈ç in the centre of the North Island and the largest lake in New Zealand ‚Äì Lake Taup≈ç. It‚Äôs 6000km¬≤ and is the size of Singapore. Apparently Singapore has a population of 4.8m. New Zealand has a population of 4.2m. No wonder we‚Äôve hardly seen anyone here.

When we arrived it was exceedingly sunny and the lake looked like shimmering glass.

Our attempt to feed the ducks failed as they were being stuffed to the gills by the group of toddlers further upshore so we moved further along into Taup≈ç and found they were motorhome friendly. Hooray! This meant we could park up on the lakefront and leave it there without worrying about where to sleep. It would be our home for the night.

First stop was the Hole in One golf challenge. Matt couldn‚Äôt resist. The prize was $10,000. How could anyone resist? It looked pretty much impossible to me and without any golfing skills whatsover Matt easily whacked 25 golfballs into the lake in all directions. Annoyingly he was doing perfectly well on his own with incorrect swing and bent posture and was getting it nearer and nearer to the target but the guy running it couldn‚Äôt resist giving him a golfing lesson and after that it kind of went pear-shaped. It _is_ possible to over-think things. Ah well it‚Äôs the taking part that counts. (Apparently 776 people have managed a hole-in-one ‚Äì one every two weeks ‚Äì so any keen golfers out there may want to risk the airfare to NZ to try it out as it‚Äôll pay for the airfare back üòâ).

Decided to get some exercise as had been particularly lazy lately. Followed the Huka Falls walk from the centre of Taup≈ç which according to the LP takes 1 to 1.5 hours and according to tourism brochures takes 2 hours. Both are pretty optimistic. They assume you are psychic and know the route as there aren‚Äôt any bloody signs until you reach Spa park (after 90mins) via random roads, a cemetery, Taup≈ç bungy and a couple of car parks. 

Still it was worth the power-walking to reach it before the sun disappeared completely behind the trees.

And it was nice not to have to move the van when we finally got back (after a pint at the local Irish bar). Just cosy up and warm our achy limbs. 

Humour at the Irish pub.
