Happy birthday Dulcie!

Decided to go tubing again today and our mission was to go all the way down the river back to Vang Vieng before 6pm. We started out at 10:30 and met a couple from Holland called Edo and Annalies in the tuk-tuk there who had done trans-mongolian, china, thailand, cambodia, now laos and onto myanmar and thailand. We arranged to meet for a drink later so they could give us their Cambodia book.

Popped to the Organic Farm before tubing. Managed to see Davone again and she gave me a Certificate of Appreciation for my time teaching.

Had some breakfast of Mulberry Green Tea, baguette, mulberry jam & home-made goats cheese. Delicious but again a little slow to arrive which meant we didn’t start tubing til 12:15.

The weather had changed today so it was overcast and wasn’t as warm as last week. Actually the water was freezing. But on we went. We managed to avoid all the missiles being thrown at us and didn’t visit any bars until Bob Marley bar about 90 mins down the river (which isn’t far as most of it is completely still and you have to paddle yourself) and bumped into Edo and Annalies again.

The views around there are wonderful. It’s on a bend and as you float down the river the limestone karsts in the background seem to grow bigger and bigger the further away you get.

2km before the end there’s a guy shouting Tuk-Tuk and a kayaker going by saying if I were you i’d get the tuk-tuk as it’s ages yet. It was only 3pm so we didn’t want to give up and persevered. Passingkids on rope swings, kids shouting beerlao, fishermen diving below the water, women and girls picking riverweed with their bamboo hats, motor boats came whizzing past and grey and pink water buffalo immersed in the river up to their noses chewing away.

Most of the river was calm but in places there were shallow rapids which you could hear before you were close enough to see them We’d hold hands down the rapids and sometimes collide into rocks or hit the ground. One dip caused a huge wave to come straight over me. It was bloomin freezing and Matt thought that was particularly hilarious.

Then we could hear booming music in the distance and realised that the sun was still shining and we weren’t that far from Vang Vieng. Turning the corner we spotted the island bars and stopped off at Brownie bar where there were 3 menus – food, drink, drugs. They’re everywhere here, offered so openly even though it’s illegal.

Even though it was freezing we popped back into the water to finish the last stretch. For some reason some local kids thought it would be entertaining to run along the bank and throw someone’s soggy pants at us. I bet they love tubers. They’re easy targets! :)& Despite the last minute attack, we made it back to the tubing place by 5pm. Mission completed.

Met up with Edo & Annalies for dinner at the organic farm cafe. It turns out Edo is famous in Holland. Someone came up and asked if he was Edo because his Dutch girlfriend was a big fan and was too embarrassed to come over and say hi!

Our favourite chill out spot with the best views in Vang Vieng –Riverside restaurant:
