If we thought the journey from Stung Treng to Ban Lung was interesting it was nothing compared to the journey to Sen Monorom. How many people can you get in a 13 seater minivan? Well if you attach a luggage rack to the back (boot open), pack everyone’s belongings onto it, tie all the extra random bags full of random stuff around it and pile 4 people on top, 4 adults on each row of seats, 2 adults in the passenger seat and an extra passenger in the driver’s seat plus as many kids as there are gaps…about 26 plus driver.

At this point a few people had been dropped off so the couple of guys left on the luggage had a little snooze.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_3358.jpg)

Could have been worse. I spotted a similar minivan, boot open, with 2 mopeds hanging off the backseats, a guy sat on each.

In the van we met Eva & Joke from Netherlands and Phillip from London. In Sen Monorom we all ended on the back of motos going to the same place 2km out of town called Nature Lodge (don’t believe the LP which says its 800m away).

There we met the manager, a lovely guy who was extra keen to learn English. Matt instantly became his teacher and the words he wanted to learn were fascinating as they came from either books over 50 years old or business magazines. Every spare moment he had when we were in close proximity to him was filled with explaining words or tenses. Matt really enjoyed it.

At Nature Lodge, relaxing on our hammock (we did use it again – it was worth lugging it all the way from India!) at our bungalow.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1050477.jpg)The bungalow was similar to Tree Top Ecolodge yet the bathroom was even more open-air with no roof. You stepped out of the back of your bungalow into an outside “garden” with stepping stones to a shower (powered by gas cylinder), loo and sink surrounded by pot plants. It was lovely except for when the gale-force winds started up and you found the hot shower sprayed every direction except over you!

Through Nature Lodge and together with Eva, Joke & Philip, we booked a 2 night jungle trek. I was apprehensive about 3 days as usually after one night we’re ready to head back. But I was really pleased we did it.

The trek included a guide called Cham plus this little guy and his mahout (elephant trainer)![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1050480.jpg)

He is Mouse, a working elephant, one of four in the village. 54 years old. Apparently elephants can live to 100 and they only sleep for 1hour a day. Never knew that.

He wasn’t there for riding. None of us wanted that kind of trek. We made sure he looked well and he just carried our supplies.

Anytime he was hungry or tired we would stop and rest so he could wander off into the jungle on his own. Or one of the guides would go and chop down some bamboo to feed him and he would chomp away until he was ready to move on.

We trekked through the jungle along both wellworn pathways and through trees and undergrowth that had barely been touched. The elephant followed us and sometimes we wondered how he could get through. We’d had to climb over some fallen trees and the elephant did the same. Carefully stepping over each trunk with each leg. Once having one back leg between two trunks. So elegant.

At one point we thought we were lost. We stood in the middle of the jungle, trees all around and the elephant and mahout wandering around us. We’d been heading for a waterfall but had come to the edge of a cliff so the mission was to find the route down.

Eventually they found it and we were on some old overgrown vehicle tracks. It did make me wonder if these had been made recently or in the seventies during the war. They seemed to be in the middle of trees with no route either way. Made me nervous thinking about cluster bombs but we were with locals who knew the area inside out (?).

We reached a river and the elephant was tired so this was our camp for the night.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_3451.jpg)”U.S. Army” hammocks with integrated mossie nets. The guides made food over a campfire and we sat on the ground at a makeshift table of an old wooden plank on top of water bottles.

By 7.30pm it was pitch black and we were all in our hammocks ready for bed. Can’t say I slept well that night. There were a lot of noises (especially ribbiting Cambodian frogs) and sounds of wood cracking around us. It was also surprisingly cold. Halfway through the night I needed the loo. There was no way I was getting out of that hammock alone and I couldn’t get Matt’s attention in the next hammock. He was out for the count. So I had to wait til sunrise.

Whilst we had breakfast the mahout cooked the meat for lunch. It is ingenious how everything these guys do uses things from the forest. Two sticks with pieces of meat between them, bound with vine. Three or four of these were leant against each other over the fire to cook.

At breakfast Matt became creative and made a dream catcher. Mouse took a liking to it, or rather a disliking, as he headbutted it and tore it out of the ground. He probably thought it was food. It’s amazing to watch an elephant pull small trees from the ground, shake it to get the dirt off and then munch it down.

Below Cham is holding a Shikara. These little critters eat dead trees and they make such a racket. Especially at dawn and dusk, the whole jungle comes alive with this chanting and screeching. It can give you a headache!

![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_3514.jpg)

A couple of hours walking and we found our waterfall and lagoon and went for a swim. A well needed cooldown on such a hot day.

![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1050527.jpg)

Whilst sunbathing I felt an ant crawling on me. When i tried to brush him off he was still there and I realised he was dead. I’ve never seen anything like it. He was completely intact. Cham said it is a form of suicide. If they can’t kill their prey they kill themselves out of shame. This little guy had tried to bite me but managed to bite my good-luck band from Laos and killed himself because of it. Poor mite.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1050540.jpg)

This is where we were setting up camp so after lunch we went to look for Mouse in the jungle. Not sure who found who first…![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1050560.jpg) The view from the other camera…![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_3525.jpg)

We left him alone and on the way back to camp our mahout had spotted a beehive ready for the taking. Well he thought it was. We thought it was madness. The biggest beehive we’ve seen at the top of this huge tree and he was planning on sending the younger guy up there to smoke it out and bring him the honey.

Here the guy who drew the short straw is building a smoking branch. Bamboo branches bound together and stuffed with leaves.

<img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="IMG_3533" border="0" alt="IMG_3533" src="http://www.mattburns.co.uk/travels/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_3533.jpg" width="640" height="427" />

He then wrapped his face with a scarf and set off up the tree. Halfway up he sets the branch of leaves smoking and carries on up to the beehive.

![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_3538.jpg)

As we watched from the ground we could see the bees swarming from the hive. At that point we’d seen enough and walked swiftly back to camp leaving all of our guides waiting for the honey. We didn’t fancy meeting any angry bees.

We waited and waited and waited and…

…show me the honey…

<img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="IMG_3550" border="0" alt="IMG_3550" src="http://www.mattburns.co.uk/travels/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_3550.jpg" width="640" height="427" />

The short straw guy had done it. He’d climbed up the tree, smoked them darn bees out and brought home the reward in a large green bag – the whole hive.

The short straw guy had sustained some injury. Mainly stings to his hands but he seemed to be happy enough. They get $10 per litre and this hive gave them 4.5 litres!

After setting up the hammocks we joined the family around the campfire for grub and rice wine. Strong stuff although not too unpleasant. One guy had caught a fish from the river, skewered it and put it over the fire. He’d decided not to kill it beforehand though and we watched as this live kebab squirmed around being cooked. Talk about fresh food.

Slept better that night. Being able to see the stars through the mossie mesh and hearing the waterfall made for a more pleasant experience. Plus I think we were all more used to the hammocks now.

Morning fishing for Cham – he managed to catch 2 little tiddlers which were promptly cooked and eaten by the mahouts![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1050606.jpg)

We joined another group with their elephant as the mahouts are from the same family.

Our trek back took us through farmland where many fruits, herbs and spices were growing like pineapples, bananas, lemongrass, galangal, etc. Cham also pointed out a loofah tree. We had no idea these grew on trees. He picked one, peeled it and I now use it in the shower!

A baby pineapple before its old enough to turn yellow![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_3635.jpg)

And we stopped for lunch at another waterfall![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_3650.jpg)

![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1050637.jpg)

Overall we enjoyed the trek. We loved the fact that its still not very well-trodden by tourists. You really felt like you were getting to see the real Cambodia with the local people. We were both shocked at how much land is being de-forested though. Local people burn the land to make it more fertile for crowing crops.

![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1050498.jpg)

On some land many trees were chopped down and left there to grow tobacco![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1050651.jpg)

Its difficult to change a way of life and this is how these people live. Everything comes from the land.

Tired and smelly but happy at the end of our trek back at Nature Lodge.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_3653.jpg)

And we had 250ml of fresh honey – delicious.
