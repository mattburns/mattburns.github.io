Itâ€™s our penultimate Wednesday of the trip and weâ€™re in Japan.

We thought it would be difficult to work out anything as Matt knows zero Japanese and my night class at uni has all but disintegrated from my memory leaving hello, goodbye, my name is Karen and the numbers 1 to 4. We neednâ€™t have worried (when I say we I mean I as Matt never worries about anything). Most things at the airport were in English as well as Japanese. Then once we were on the first train into Tokyo we were adopted by two lovely ladies who didnâ€™t know each other but who worked out between them where we needed to go and then continued to give us tips on what to see where. Matt wrote down his website address on a bit of paper for one of them and the other took a photo of it with her phone so they could both have it. They told us when it was our stop and waved and smiled through the window as the train pulled away. So sweet.

Our hostel Kâ€™s House Tokyo Oasis is a bit of a trek from the station with our bags but is also very lovely. Our exchange notes for our [Japan Rail Pass][2] had also arrived from Paris (via Delhi & Shanghai!) which is excellent news.

Matt was extremely excited to see our ensuite electronic loo with sensor lighting, heated seat, two water sprays and music to play whilst you flush. The cistern is very economical â€“ it is filled by a small tap running into a small sink so that you can wash your hands at the same time. Genius.

Our next mission was to find food (surprise surprise).

We explored the local area of Asakusa and discovered we were just around the corner from one of Tokyoâ€™s most popular tourist attractions â€“ Senso-ji temple.

Being marvin, we were blinkered to it and had our first taste of Japan â€“ gooey caramelised rice balls on sticks. They reminded me of the dates on sticks you get at Christmas. Our side-street ramen stop was more appetising.

Ventured into the underground system and our first stop was Ginza. Once again we were helped by a lovely lady on the tube who gave us directions.

Why Ginza? For the Sony Building of course. 6 floors of Sony stuff AND an aquarium AND 3D glasses  ðŸ˜€Then just around the corner was the Leica gallery. Matt was in heaven (although a little disappointed there were no walking robots to be seen).

Next stop Akihabara, Electric City. 6 storeys again, this time of arcade games that made no sense to us because a) everything was written in Kanji and b) they were mental. Like trying to flip a table and corpse at a funeral???! But hey they were fun anyway.

Final stop of the day, Shibuya, for sushi in a teeny alleyway restaurant where the staff didnâ€™t speak English. Yet again proving how lovely Japanese people are, the waitress asked another customer to come help us and the girl popped over, sat at our table and made some recommendations on what to order. She suggested an egg dish which turned out to be a cup of scrambled eggs with fish eaten with a tiny wooden spoon. Something we would never have known how to order or even thought or ordering, It was delicious.

Thoughts after our first day in Japan. Wish we had longer than 9 days to enjoy it!
