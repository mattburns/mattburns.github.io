Glorious sunshine filled the crystal clear blue skies and what was going to be a quiet day with a quick visit to the thermal spa and then onto Rotorua turned into another adrenaline-filled day in the form of SKYDIVING! 

At 10:40 we thought we‚Äôd just ring up to enquire about how much it was and if they were flying today.

An hour later we were at the centre getting into our gear and at 12:45 we were climbing into Taup≈ç Tandem Skydive‚Äôs banana coloured plane with a large toothy grin on the front (of the plane. ‚Äì_Ed_). 15 mins later the sliding door went up and I was first out of the plane.

This is my second tandem skydive and after doing the bungy I thought I was now fearless. But walking to the plane my nerves started getting to me and in the plane I couldn‚Äôt relax. Especially when they brought out the oxygen as we got to 13,000ft. Hence the stressed-out look at the beginning of the video. 

Matt on the other hand seemed his usual chilled-out self the whole time but I think secretly he was peeing himself it being his first ever skydive. It‚Äôs not natural to throw yourself out of a plane.

But surprisingly (for me) as soon as I had to manoeuvre to the door of the plane and dangle in mid-air I was completely chilled and loved that feeling of falling out into the sky and start whizzing towards the earth. 

60 seconds of freefall from 15000 to 5000ft with a guy recording every second of it followed by 5 mins under the parachute where I got to steer us a couple of times left and right towards beautiful Lake Taup≈ç. 

Somehow although I left the plane before Matt, he landed before me so was there to wave as I landed. 

We then had to do some random stupid celebration for the DVD. That was the hardest bit. You‚Äôre still completely spaced out from dropping 15000ft and you‚Äôre being asked to act stupid in front of a video camera. I think we looked stupid enough doing not much at all.

So anyway here are a couple of pics and the silly videos of me & Matt.

_FUN VIDEOS TO BE INCLUDED AT A LATER DATE üòÄ_

What do you do after something as fantabulous as skydiving? Go to the local natural thermal spa and chill out of course. It was boiling hot water and extremely relaxing sat in clear spring water on a bed of smooth gravel with pumice-like rocks floating by.
