We went to Myanmar (Burma) today for 2 reasons. 

One: we wanted to visit Myanmar (our 6th country so far if you include Nepal :) ) 

Two: our Thai visa ran out today so we needed to leave the country or pay a fine

It was a surreal and yet dull experience. And far too easy.

10:00 Bus Chiang Rai to Mae Sai (Thai border town)

11:30 Sorng Thaew from Mae Sai bus station to the border

11:45 queue for 5 minutes at Thai passport control to get your passport stamped out of the country

Turn your watch back half hour (there’s a time difference between Thailand and Myanmar)

Walk 2 mins across the bridge and get taken into a curtained room with Myanmar officials who ask for 500THB each. It’s supposed to be either $10 or 500THB according to Thailand notices but they were adamant they would only take Baht. That’s because 10 dollars to us and them is worth a lot bloody less than 500 Baht. Very annoying. Get your mugshot taken and a temporary photo ID card given to you whilst leaving your passport with these guys.

Which is a dump rather than golden. Sorry but it is. Dusty streets, A huge market with every other stall selling the same counterfeit stuff – handbags, sunglasses, underwear, perfume, electronics and hundreds of guys wandering past trying to flog you Saddam Hussein playing cards and dodgy packets of fags. There were no flavours of the real Myanmar. Not even a restaurant to try the local food or drink.

12:45 exchange ID cards for passports and leave Myanmar

That was the most expensive hour we’ve had in Thailand. Not that it was in Thailand exactly so I guess it was the cheapest day we’ve had in Myanmar.

Still we stepped into Myanmar. And renewed our visas. So mission accomplished.

They have a sign by the crossing for the most Northern part of Thailand. Here it is:

And here is Matt eating his lunch in a restaurant on the Thai side with said sign **behind** him. I.e. more southerly than him ;)

And this is a bloke fishing in the river that forms the border catching fish by electrocuting them with a giant electrified fly swatter (yes that is an electric wire which runs through the water and up to the guy leaning over the railing in the top left of the photo):

In the sorng theaw on the way back to the bus station an old guy started chatting to Matt and he was originally from Myanmar but had moved to Thailand 20 years ago. He said his sons still live in the capital of Myanmar and it’s a hard life because of military rule. I wonder if he ever sees them. We don’t know what the deal is with people leaving or visiting Myanmar. There are a certain number of tourist visas permitted each year but they still restrict the areas you can visit.

If anyone is wondering why we only went to Tachileik. It’s because you can only get a one day permit to go to Tachileik only. It is possible to get a 14 day visa to go to Kengtung and Mong La but you can’t go any further into Myanmar than that without applying for the special visa which we’re not keen to do. We do wonder what it’s like though. It can’t be like Tachileik. A strange no-mans land.

By 16:30 we were back in Chiang Rai.

Tried another different cuisine tonight.&nbsp; Korean. An array of dishes appeared on the table with a large jug of cold weak tea. It was a culinary delight for our tastebuds and made a nice change from thai curry and noodles (don’t get me wrong though I could eat thai curry every meal!).
