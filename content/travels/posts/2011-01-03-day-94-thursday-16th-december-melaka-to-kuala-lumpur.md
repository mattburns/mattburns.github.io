More dim sum yum. Extra this time. Felt like pigs but the food here is lush.

Sam from Jalan Jalan was brilliant in advising us to walk to the bottom of Chinatown instead of the top to catch the local bus to the bus station. I’d read that it could take an hour from the square but it took less than 10 mins from the other end. Fab. We always seem to travel with our backpacks when the sun is hottest and today was particularly muggy and humid inbetween the rain showers. We tried desperately to shelter in the shade of a lamppost whilst waiting for the bus. We only had to wait 3 mins but we were both feeling manky by the time we boarded. No wonder Matt can’t put weight on!

So got to Melaka bus station no problem, bought bus tickets to Kuala Lumpur no problem and sat in airconditioned McDonalds where the coffee tastes as dodgy as at home til the very nice comfy bus turned up. Buses over here are so nice. And it’s so easy to travel around. 

We’d bought coconut syrup cakes (a Melaka special) for the journey. (Decided to pass on the strange tasting durian ones this time). They’re so sweet and stodgy that you can’t eat more than 2 in a sitting. Even me with my extra strong sweet tooth couldn’t do it. You could taste the calories hitting your backside as you swallowed. Mmmmmm.

3 hours later we were in KL and after getting a little frustrated trying to cross the road (KL is built for cars not pedestrians) followed by a little bit lost in the biggest mall I have ever seen (Berjaya Times Square has 10 stories, a bowling alley and an indoor theme park which includes a rollercoaster – we thought we could get to our hostel by walking through the mall – big mistake) we finally reached Irsia Guest House. A similar place to Footprints in Singapore as in cute rooms with no windows and shared bathrooms but loads cheaper and more bananas for breakfast. Also in a fab location again (as it was actually just behind the Berjaya Times Square mall / Hotel & Spa).

Tried to get a good view of the Petronas Towers and failed. We could see the tops of them and the top of the KL Tower from the street which was cool but it was difficult to find a proper full-length in all its glory view. So we gave up and found a bar doing happy hour wine. Yes please! And delicious cheese. CHEESE! Proper god damn cheese. We missed you so much. Ok there was no cheddar or wensleydale on the menu but camembert, gorgonzola, french blue cheese & smoked Spanish cheese. The bar is called Carmen’s Vinothek which sounds cheesy (excuse the pun) but really is a lovely winebar and worth every Malaysian Ringgitt!
