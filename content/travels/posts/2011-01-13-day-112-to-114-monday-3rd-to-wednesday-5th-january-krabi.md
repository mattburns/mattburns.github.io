Beach time is over. Back to the proper mainland and the rest of Thailand.

Our last bit of Railay sightseeing was the Diamond Cave. We’d walked past it every time we’d been anywhere away from Railay Cabana.

On the way to the cave Matt informed me what had been in his towel…a scorpion. Which had crawled on him. Only when he’d knocked it onto the ground had he seen what it was. Yep glad I didn’t ask before we’d checked out.

This time we booked our longtail trip and transfer to Krabi through a travel agent at Viewpoint in Railay. That meant a tractor & trailer lift out to the longtail – no soggy ankles for a change – and a luxurious limo style minibus to the centre of Krabi. Nice.

Stayed at Pak Up Hostel just metres away from the drop-off point. We were going to opt for dorm beds as we hadn’t tried it yet and we’re trying to get back to budget spending. However the woman gave us an offer we couldn’t refuse. For an extra 100THB we could have a private room. So the 2 of us ended up in an 8-bed dorm called History (Pakup had a school theme). It was huge! The hostel was obviously relatively new. The furniture was good quality, the walls were white and clean, the common area had cool beanbags and funky retro sofas. And the rooftop bar was classy. It was more of a grown-up version of Footprints Hostel in Singapore.

Krabi didn’t seem like it had much to offer but Matt could have stayed there forever after walking into the Relax Coffee & Restaurant opposite Pakup, realising they did bangers & mash (which coincidentally he’d only been craving earlier that day) and it being the best sausages & mash & gravy he’d ever had. Better than mine apparently.

Walking around the waterfront we encountered a bizarre sight. Hundreds of one-claw miniature crabs waving their one claw around in the air like some kind of ritual. And even more bizarrely some creatures moving in and out of the water that looked like part of the evolutionary chain. Kind of large slugs with gills. No idea what they were.

Krabi came alive in the evening with a large street market with neon lights. Stalls selling all kinds of food, mostly bar-b-qued – chicken legs with the foot still on, squid and octopus kebabs, larvae and grasshoppers, your usual noodles and lots of sweet squidgy things filled with orange or green gunge or that sickly fake marshmallow-like cream.

Our favourite purchase was an ice-lolly made from fanta. A woman sat with a big metal tub filled with mini-milk shape containers which she topped up with fanta and a kebab stick and hey presto instant lolly. We figured the tub must have been contained liquid nitrogen for them to freeze so quickly. What a genius idea.

Another area of the market was full of homemade fairground games. How many balloons can you burst with darts, can you throw a ping-pong ball into a pot with the hole half a mm wider than the ping pong ball or catch a balloon going round a big plastic greenhouse?? (We didn’t get this game).

On Tuesday we tried to get bus tickets to Bangkok without success. Most buses were full or crappy tourist buses that we’d heard you shouldn’t travel on. Matt did some investigation and had this confirmed by an experienced traveller now working in a local tourist travel agents when he should have been trying to flog us tourist bus tickets. Very kind of him. He did offer government tickets for 1150 THB I think it was which was way more than what we thought.

Matt eventually got a sǎwngthǎew to the bus station and got us tickets on the next government VIP bus available from a reluctant teller who just didn’t want to give him any information or tickets whatsoever until she had to give in as she was the only person selling VIP tickets to Bangkok! Anyway that bus wasn’t until Wednesday evening (and cost only 950 THB each) so we checked back into Pakup into the same History dorm with just the two of us and had another groundhog day.

Which was fine as we spent Wednesday eating more good food at ‘Relax Coffee and Restaurant’ and then having a nose around Krabi and finding these fascinating traffic lights at a crossroads. There was one on each side. How do people think of these things? (Notice the green counter? This is on most traffic lights in Thailand for cars & pedestrians. Green (unsurprisingly) tells you how long it will stay green for. Red numbers tell you how long you have left to wait for. Great idea. Why doesn’t that happen in the UK?)
