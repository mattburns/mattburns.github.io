Met up with Dulcie’s sister Esme, her husband Gus & 3-month baby Cleo for lunch as they are currently living in Singapore. Had lunch at a very lush Indonesian restaurant where we fell in love with Beef Penang and I fell for lychee juice made which comes with fresh lychees in the glass. Not sure Matt fell in love with his bright pink strawberry fizzy shake but he had to try it.

Esme kindly invited us back to their condo which was beautiful with amazing views across the city and a pool which we took a dip in. The first swimming pool so far this trip. We felt weak trying to swim one length. 

Tried something called a Durian pancake. I asked what was in the pancake and the woman looked at me weirdly and said “durian”. Ah I see…no idea… As we waited for the pancakes to cook another customer asked us if we’d tried them before because durian is an acquired taste. That worried us. It was strange, almost cheese & onion pasty like but it’s meant to be a fruit we think. It didn’t kill us anyway.

On Esme’s advice we then spent sunset with a cocktail / Erdinger on the 71st floor of the New Asia bar in Swiss Belhotel which is the tallest building in Singapore and so has fab views of the city. Only when we got to the front door did we think maybe we should have gone back to get changed into something smarter and dumped the wet swimming gear first. We did feel a bit of a pair of scruffs sat in a swanky bar surrounded by people in business attire or dressed for dinner. But then again we wouldn’t have got there early enough to get the window seat (and for happy hour) so who cares what we look like if we can pay the bill right? 

I strongly recommend the Nutty Professor cocktail. Vodka, gold rum and amaretto served in a martini glass. A ferrero rocher in a glass. Mmmmm….

Second place tipped by Esme was Lao Pa Tat, a marketplace near Raffles Place, where piles of satay chicken were being cooked and scoffed at plastic tables & chairs in a cordoned off street. Lao Pa Tat itself is a large hawkers food hall under an ornate metal covered structure. We read that this was originally a marketplace in Glasgow and was shipped to Singapore in the 1800s! We tried a dessert called Mango Milk Ice that is what it says on the tin. Shaved ice with milk and chopped mango and mango juice. It tasted good. Kind of like mini milks.
