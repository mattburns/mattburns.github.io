We made it.

2:30 alarm. 

3:15 left apartment.

3:35 on bus to airport.

4:10 check in.

4:40 security check – Matt gets searched twice – he’s got the hoody and the beanie but of course it _is_ random.

6:00 (NZ time) on the easyjet style plane for an uneasy flight. You would have thought by now with a helicopter ride up glaciers, bungy jumping over a canyon and a light aircraft flight 15000m up to fall out into the sky, a 4 hour flight would be a doddle. Nope. i didn’t like the fact we were one of the first flights to go with Qantas since the ash cloud cleared. And we had a couple of moments of turbulence. that wouldn’t have been so bad hadn’t the co-pilot say in a hurried voice&nbsp; “please can all passengers return to their seats immediately and put their seatbelts on” followed by two air stewardesses rushing through to the front of the plane. It’s not something I’m comfortable with.

8:00 (Oz time) So anyway we landed after a bit more turbulence through thick cloud and now we’re in Brisbane!

I was once again paranoid about the customs procedure. They say you have to declare all food items and I’d made Matt bring all the condiments from the van including chill sauce. So we declared them and they were fine about it. Although the drug-squad dog seemed interested in the chill sauce. It meant we ditched the last of our Cambodian honey but it was looking a bit worse for wear after 4 months of being lugged around.

From first glance of Brisbane we like it. It’s very built up but very laid back. 

To take stock and work out a plan of action we needed caffeine and what better way to do it than a mug of cappuccino with a side of free cinnamon doughnuts. We were buzzing and made our way to a central motel called Acacia which had the feeling of being an old hospital crossed with an old people’s home. It must have been built in the 70s and never been touched since. Still it was a bed for the night.

Not wanting to stay in Acacia too long we headed out into Brisbane city centre and quickly found interesting architecture, both british colonial and aussie modern.

The harbourside was particularly interesting. On the one side of the river the CBD.

On the other side it stretched from the Brisbane Art gallery, the Gallery of Modern Art and the City Library at one end to the free swimming pool with free superficial beach & palm trees (they were real) surrounded by lawned areas with free bar-b-qs at the other and a giant ferris wheel inbetween.

We ventured into both galleries and the library. The latter of course to use the free wifi and join the hundreds of others scattered around a huge room plugged into their laptops. It felt like the future.

Lovely city. The only letdown, is it’s actually pretty cold and a little rainy. Where is the warm sunshine we were promised Gold Coast?!
