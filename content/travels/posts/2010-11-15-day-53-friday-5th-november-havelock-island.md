Happy Anniversary to Steve & Anne-Marie! 

It’s bonfire night in the UK and you’d be forgiven for thinking they have the same tradition over here as kids are running round with sparklers and setting off fireworks and the loudest firecrackers I’ve ever heard giving this old woman many mini heart attacks. It’s the Diwali festival of lights today. Such a shame it’s hardly stopped raining. We have been in the hut most of the day. I ventured to the beach to do a quick weather check earlier today only to see the storm coming once again across the sea towards me and by the time I’d run the 100m back to the hut I was drenched! We’ve heard the edge of a cyclone is hitting the island and it’s expected to stay for another few days. Just our luck! I’m glad we had a few days of sun. We met a couple at dinner who arrived on Tuesday and have had rain everyday. Ferries were cancelled for some of Wednesday and all of Thursday due to rough seas. They’d heard from a guy who arrived on the last ferry that only about 5% of the passengers managed to survive without being sick. Ugh.

Ooh Ooh we passed our PADI Open Water Diving certification. Whoop! We have our names down for diving again Sunday if the weather gets better and Matt’s shotgunned the underwater camera :)

Haven’t mentioned food much lately have I? Well as Havelock is pretty small there isn’t an abundance of restaurants and it’s been dark and rainy so we have been rotating in a triangular formation between Eldorado for basic noodles, paratha and puri, Anju-coco-resto across the road with good fish & prawns and Full Moon cafe, which admittedly I have mentioned but not enough. We had very good west indian fish curry and the scrummiest warm apple & cinnamon muffin today. I could have kissed the woman. I have been praying for good cake since leaving Darjeeling’s Cake Lady and it was delivered!&nbsp; 

We tried to venture outside of our safety net this evening even though we risked getting wet and run over (no streetlights here and crazy moped & jeep drivers who only use their headlights sporadically) but failed miserably. First we headed to “World’s best pizza – cheap price” as we are desperate for pizza. On receipt of the menu it looked surprisingly similar to all the other places round here. Curry, chapati, pakora, etc etc. In one corner under “Veg dishes” one line said Pizza 100 rupees. Interesting we thought for a pizza place with such high claims of being the best in the world. On enquiring what pizza they had the guy innocently answered “one flavour of tomato sauce”. Of course, had to be tomato sauce. Because they have that with _everything_ here. I thought Wendy ate a lot of ketchup but in India it’s served with anything you order. That and green chilli sauce which I love. Anyway we decided to leave as it had severely scarred us. The only other couple in the restaurant said they’d found the name a little misleading too but had been too lazy to leave once they’d got there! This place is honestly losing out. If they were serving pizza, they’d make a killing. It doesn’t have to be the world’s best. Just any pizza with topping will be better than none when you’re claiming to be a pizza restaurant.

We wandered 15mins in the other direction to Sunrise Resort which we’d heard had OK food and was the busiest bar in the restaurant. Right. Any night except tonight yeah. Unless you call one old hippy sat alone staring out towards the trees a buzzing bar. I’m sure he’d been sat there in the exact same place when we’d checked out the accommodation last Friday lunchtime. Hope he’s still breathing.

So back to trusty Anju-coco we trotted for delicious fish special with garlic bread. Plus a special Diwali festival dish of rice pudding with cardamom. They’re not big on their puddings in India. Cake Lady needs to branch out!
