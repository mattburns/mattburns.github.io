Day 4 in Delhi
  
Off to Varanasi today so suddenly thought we ought to do some sightseeing. We chose the Lotus temple and it’s definitely worth seeing. An amazing bit of modern architecture which we think is almost as “wow” as the Taj Mahal. It looks like some kind of futuristic building set amongst green gardens and palm trees. It could be from a sci-fi film. Kind of reminded me of Logan’s run in a way. Pure white building with underground buildings in the grounds where the people emerge from to relax in the gardens of paradise until one is chosen for sacrifice!

As is always the case with our blog we have to mention food and we found the Open Hand cafe (another LP recommendation) in Pahar Ganj which was a really trendy little place with a full glass front and we sat in there eating good breakfast and drinking good coffee watching the mad world of India pass by outside. Another good haven. There’s one in Varanasi too so might have to try that one.

Finally escaped Delhi on the 18:30 train. As we were settling down I noticed that there was a spare seat and who should turn up to sit in it but Paul from Sam’s Cafe…
