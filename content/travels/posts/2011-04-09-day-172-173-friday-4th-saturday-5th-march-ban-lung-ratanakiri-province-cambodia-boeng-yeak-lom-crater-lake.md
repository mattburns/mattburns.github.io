Funny minivan journey with 16 adult passengers, 3 babies (one naked, one half-naked from the waist down) and an 8 year old carrying a small plastic bag that chirped. To get to Ban Lung in Ratanakiri province in the north east of Cambodia.

Found another form of paradise again in Tree Top Ecolodge. Very gorgeous wooden bungalows on stilts with all furniture made from reclaimed wood including a very simple but beautiful lamp which had a tree stump for a base and a branch for the stand. The verandah ran the length of two sides of the bungalow with deckchair, hammock & desk and views across the Cambodian countryside. ![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1050420.jpg)

Plus a live-in lizard that appeared each evening to stare at us from the rafters.![](/travels-wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_3239.jpg)

This area is good for trekking but we’re short on time and really want to go to Sen Monorom in the East/South-East so we’re compromising and going to head in that direction tomorrow via Kratie.

**Boeng Yeak Lom**

Rode our clattery hired bikes up & down, up & down to a blue crater lake believed to have been formed over 700,000 years ago. Described as a volcanic crater but locals believe a meteor hit the earth as it is so perfectly round. After a unique breakfast of dried strips of beef and a massive plate of steamed rice washed down with our first combined hot & iced coffee (funny what can get lost in translation) we had a relaxing day by the lake with a teeny bit of swimming & a few run & jumps in by Matt (I am officially a wuss).

One tip if you do visit this lake. Don’t bother walking all the way around as we did. There is nothing whatsoever to see past the piers. Just lots of trees and grass and bugs.
