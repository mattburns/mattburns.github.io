Fish & chips by the sea at Oamaru. Our first in NZ. Lip-smackingly tasty freshly battered elephant fish & sole.

Tried to see some more penguins but we had arrived too early in the day and as we needed to gain more ground north continued our road trip to a holiday park in Timaru which was owned by a nice man from Nottingham whom had emigrated here 10 years ago when the exchange rate was NZ$3.7 to the £. Shame it still isn’t the same rate nowadays otherwise our trip could be twice as long.
