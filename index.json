In a statement last night he said:\n Councils across the country have huge bills for supplying services available for free universally to taxpayers. It is only fair and right that people shouldn’t have to pay for the bits they don’t use. Should blind people have to pay for cleaning graffiti? Should illiterate people have to pay for libraries? There are lots of very sick people in hospitals and that costs lots of money, why should healthy people foot the bill?\n Parkrunner Julie also thought it was a great idea:\n I got into parkrun because I was overweight and it was free so I had no excuse not to get fit. Now the council have changed this I can stay in bed on Saturdays eating chocolate guilt-free 🙂\n The council said this is just the start and aims to have the lowest council tax charges in the UK. A Council spokesman announced:\n Emptying dog litter bins is a messy and expensive job. People that don’t have dogs shouldn’t have to pay the “brown tax”. We will be replacing all dog litter bins with high tech bins that require dog-walkers to pay 50p in order to make a “deposit”.\n ","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/blog/2016/04/13/cameron-hails-stoke-gifford-parish-council-as-most-forward-thinking-in-uk/","summary":"Stoke Gifford Parish Council voted last night in favour of charging parkrun for use of the local park for members of the public to use for free. The PM has applauded the decision saying that it signifies just the start of some great savings that can be made by government.

Wahoo! Free money!\nUnfortunately, as much as I just wanted to cash the cheque and forget about it, I knew there was something wrong. After a bit of rummaging through my records I realised that the amount overpaid was exactly the same as the amount I’ve just paid to HMRC for my latest PAYE bill. I keep detailed records of everything I do so I noticed that I had decided to make that PAYE payment by direct bank transfer this month using Lloyds online banking. If you make a direct transfer to HMRC, it is important you set the transaction reference correctly so that they know what the money is for (PAYE, Corporation Tax etc.). My notes said I used the correct reference so I checked my bank statement and there was the mistake. It had gone to my Corporation Tax account reference.\nI took another look at the Lloyds website for transferring money and clicked the help tooltip for the reference field:\nYes. That’s right. Changing the contents of the reference text field makes no difference. If you’re transferring money to someone you’ve paid before it will ignore the reference use the reference you used the first time. The “solution” is to create another copy of the same recipient.\nWhat are Lloyds playing at? They acknowledge “for technical reasons” (a.k.a. “someone screwed up”). Why bother adding that tooltip instead of disabling the textfield? I think this is a serious bug and had I not noticed it, I could have got in trouble with HMRC for not paying my PAYE in time.\nSort it out Lloyds.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/blog/2015/07/21/how-i-got-over-1200-from-hmrc-with-this-one-simple-trick/","summary":"You won’t believe this hack!\nI recently got a cheque for over £1200 from HMRC for “overpaid corporation tax”.

I’m a programmer and amateur photographer, if anyone should find this easy it should be me. How hard can it be?Somehow, I needed to resize and re-save my photo so that it had just the right border around the edge so that when the new image was printed at 4×6\u0026quot; my picture would be in the middle at exactly 4x4cm ready for me to cut out. I scratched my head, searched around and even asked some experts for advice. I ended up installing a command-line image resizing tool and calculated just the right command to convert my photo:\n“C:\\Program Files\\ImageMagick-6.6.0-Q16\\convert.exe” input.jpg -border 137.5%x75% output.jpg The values 137.5 and 75 are the magic here that I had to work out myself using a bit of maths. This is clearly too complicated and enough of an effort to make it one of those jobs that never gets done.\nOddPrints was born Although I spend my days working on and improving StolenCameraFinder (my baby!) I made time to knock up a basic website that solved this problem online in a simple way: OddPrints.com. Now anyone can just upload a photo, type in the size of their frame, and re-download the image ready for printing. We run the site for free with no watermarks or adverts or any other nonsense. There are too many crappy websites on the internet and we’re doing our best not to contribute to that!\nSince then we now allow people to just order prints directly from the site. We don’t force people into doing that, we just offer people a simple honest service that they are welcome to use. If you want to use the site for free then print the images at home or in the local chemist that’s fine with us. We’re not going to slap watermarks over it or spam you or anything else that’s evil. Why do companies do that?!In fact, when you order prints from OddPrints you don’t even have to register and log in or any of that BS. Just pay with PayPal and we’ll get the prints posted to you. Done.\n1000 Customers! (almost) Anyway, now comes the reason I’m writing this post. I just looked at my logs and somehow there has been over 900 customers so far. Now I know this is absolute chicken-feed for big companies, I’m sure photobox get that daily, but for me it feels fantastic. I have a folder full of emails from customers saying how happy they are with their prints. When I get one of these I reply personally with a big smile on my face thanking them. There are photos of babies, weddings and happy holiday moments hanging on your walls and being given as presents thanks to this little site.\n That’s why I’ve decided that our 1000th customer will get their order for free and a £50 voucher to use on the site 🙂\n \nI hope that doesn’t sound like a cheap marketing gimmick, I genuinely want to thank every customer and everyone else that’s helped support the site and this is my way of showing that. Who knows, maybe I’ll be writing a similar post marking the 10,000th customer soon 😉\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/blog/2013/10/03/customer1000/","summary":"Before OddPrints… A short while ago I wanted to print some photos for a little frame (4x4cm).

This gives the arc a more traditional square capped edge:\n.spinner { ... border: solid 3px rgba(0,0,0,0); border-top-color: #DB73D7; ... } You can play with the code in this JS Bin.

To me it seems like the obvious thing to do but very few websites seem to employ the technique. I thought I’d explain my thoughts and I’d love to hear what you think…\n1 – Sharper This is the main reason. I recently bought a Retina MacBook Pro and the screen quality is amazing. I like to think I’m an optimist and I would normally just be happy with the obvious upgrade. The reality is that I mainly notice the apps and graphics that are not “retina ready” and just look soft and fuzzy. This in turn makes me feel dirty that I have to interact with something so dated and stupid. Here is an exaggerated example of what my logo looked like when zoomed in.\n\nand now using @font-face…\nFor a programming geek, I am relatively late to stumping up the cash to join The Retina Revolution. Until now, I was blissfully unaware that work needed to be done to make your site shine on such a device. If you don’t own a retina device, pop in your local fruit shop, grab a retina macbook pro and browse a few websites. It won’t take you long to find a website that has a logo or icons that look noticibly fuzzy next to that the razor-sharp text in the body. I hope it’s not your site. People much smarter than me agree that you should make sure your logo and icons look good on such a display. The recent launch of the Chromebook Pixel should be further evidence that we’re on the brink of a future with more pixels.\n2 – SEO This should be obvious but images aren’t as simple as text when it comes to being indexed by Google. Keeping things as plain html markup means I don’t have to worry about sensible alt attributes or whatever. You can still cut-and-paste the text which is handy sometimes (but not so handy that it deserves its own section, jeez). This isn’t a big reason, more a bonus feature.\n3 – Internationalisation If you happen to write an awesome website that is used by people around the world, they probably want to read it in their language. I can’t be bothered to internationalise my sites when Google translate does such a good job. I recently saw a French blog post and this screenshot made me look twice:\nNow, of course this could be seen as a bad thing if your logo is poorly translated or your branding is so important that you need full control of the exact appearance. As I’m writing this, the more I’m going off this point. It not like my url changes so why should my logo… thoughts please!\n4 – Accessibility Cons Legacy browser support is sketchy. Initial page load may be slower if using javascript or the font files are big. You may experience a flash of un-styled text in some browsers. These problems can all be reduced with crazy tweeks like only including the characters you need in the font file, or base64 encoding them in the css. Tools such as fontsquirrel, Google’s web fonts (and loader) solve most things, but even that takes a little reading just to get your head around. This all boils down to the same con: It’s hard to get right. Of course, if you’re already using web fonts elsewhere on your site, you’ve already solved these problems 😉\nAlternatives If you still want to serve images, and I’m not putting forward a fantastic argument why you shouldn’t, I strongly recommend serving higher-resolution alternatives to displays that need them. It’s pretty simple to do with libraries such as retina.js. For example, when on my laptop, microsoft.com serves me a nice high resolution version of their logo. Fail to do this and your site just lost 5 subconscious quality points in your customer’s noggin.\nYou could also just upload your logo as a vector image. Similar problems with browser support but certainly a valid option.\nConclusion Designing your logo as a simple font that can be rendered in a browser isn’t for everyone. Big companies pay designers to draw clever graphics that need more than just a font file, and many websites care more about appearing the same on as many devices and browsers as possible. If however you just want something that looks great on most platforms but you care more about impressing those visitors on modern, expensive devices, maybe a font-face/css/svg logo is for you.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/blog/2013/02/24/4-reasons-to-design-your-logo-in-css-and-a-few-why-you-shouldnt/","summary":"Intro I recently changed the OddPrints logo on the website from an image to simple text styled with CSS and @font-face.

It supports mSATA, but don’t be tempted, just stick with a separate SSD. Keep your OS and apps on the SSD, and your files on the HDD. I’m using the stock CPU fan and it works well and is quiet. The case is pretty big. I prefer that but a much smaller one would be fine. I don’t play games so this build doesn’t have a graphics card. The onboard graphics are more than good enough for me (no problems with HD video etc.). No doubt I’ll buy one in a year or two when I need to drive a 50\u0026quot; retina display 😉 View all the parts in this Amazon wish list. You don’t need any special brackets for the SSD, this case already has mounting screws for it. You don’t need any thermal paste, it all just clicks together.  Got any improvements or updates?

The range of Fixies was incredible – even ones carved from wood.\nWe were to continue straight to Cabot, but were halted by the sounds of a random band coming from The Old Duke. Couldn’t resist a half-pint of Bath Ales Gem and a mini jig before going full-circle back to our bikes by St Nicks.\nAgain we were distracted from our original destination by a PA system in Castle Park and our diversion took us to a record-breaking attempt for the most dancing zombies in the same place at the same time??!!\nWe finally ended up in Cabot Circus at 5pm.

A stable release. It even includes some work that allows it to run on Google App Engine.\nTime to crack on, right, where’s the documentation. Oh. There isn’t any because it has:\n Self-documented classes that describe the APIs\n Ok, fine, I’m cool with that. I’ve downloaded the SDK, added it to my project. Now all I have to do is rummage through the packages to find the class that will serve as my entry point to the API. Tell you what, I’ll give you a head start, here’s the package it’s in.\nYep, there it is, buried amongst 172 generated classes, you want the PayPalAPIInterfaceServiceService. What a name. I’ve gone through the JAXB pain far too many times in my java career and although I don’t find it particularly difficult any more, it is still impossible not to vomit over my keyboard each time I’m forced to code against it.\nThis is (my first attempt at) a very basic call to the api:\nPayPalAPIInterfaceServiceService paypal;\rtry {\rInputStream is = req\r.getSession()\r.getServletContext()\r.getResourceAsStream(\r\u0026quot;/WEB-INF/paypal-sdk-config.properties\u0026quot;);\rpaypal = new PayPalAPIInterfaceServiceService(is);\r} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\r// Urgh, I have to catch a checked exception that can only be thrown\r// by the other, overloaded, file-based constructor.

Having to write this kind of shit gives java a really bad name. Is there really any improvement over just calling the API without any SDK? There are so many things wrong with this that I’m surely going to miss stuff:\n Declaring you throw a checked expection that you don’t throw. Inconsistent naming. The insane object nesting generated by JAXB .(SetExpressCheckoutReq\u0026gt;SetExpressCheckoutRequestType\u0026gt;SetExpressCheckoutRequestDetailsType etc.). Who cares we’re using a strongly typed language, let’s pass doubles in strings and just document what’s valid – “Must not exceed $10,000 USD in any currency. No currency symbol. Decimal separator must be a period (.), and the thousands separator must be a comma (,).” Redundantly having to pass the total for the whole basket.  Matt, keep calm, breath deeply. It’s ok. You can wrap this cruft up behind a nice clean bit of code and you never have to look at it again…\nPhew, let’s run it.\nBang. That threw a ClientActionRequiredException. Looking at the response I can see “XML syntax error”. No more help than that. Time to take a look at the xml that was generated and I quickly spot that it’s not legal:\n\u0026lt;ebl:Amount0.5\u0026lt;/ebl:Amount\u0026gt;\nWhat? I’m using an SDK and it still generates duff xml. I was pretty pissed off at this point and lost my cool. I glanced at the source code and thought I’d found a bug so fired off a bug report.\nIt turned out it wasn’t so much a bug, just an example of why munging xml by hand is a bad idea. It was my fault for not sending the currency code for each and every item in the basket.\nNow we can add one more thing to our list or gripes:\n Having to pass the currency code for each item in basket.  I didn’t want this post to be a rant. No-one wants to read that, I’m just frustrated that it’s taken me two days to get to the simplest end-to-end test. If anyone at PayPal reads this, please hide away the JAXB objects and expose a cleaner set of interfaces for the java SDK. It’s the sort of thing I would normally write myself and open-source, but I feel in this case, it’s not something that would benefit the people so much as it would benefit PayPal.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/blog/2012/08/17/fun-and-games-with-the-new-paypal-java-sdk/","summary":"Up until now I’ve handled my payments for stolencamerafinder and OddPrints with Google Wallet.

Matt had gone from one dream to another.\nWe knew if we headed back to K’s House it would be too early to check in so decided to do some last minute sightseeing. We hadn’t seen the famous Shibuya pedestrian crossing, or scramble, as I have just found out it is called.\nOr the hip shopping street Takeshita in Harajuku with the trendy shops for teens as it is described in the LP.\nAnd more Takoyaki had to be eaten before we left Japan of course. Where in Britain can we possibly find balls of octopus covered in cheese?\nOn the route back to the third and final stay at K’s House Tokyo, we spotted an animated noodle bowl, with chopsticks bobbing up and down.\nHey we hadn’t slept for 36 hours so we were easily amused. Also due to this fact, we had to spend a couple of hours in the hotel snoozing to have some kind of chance of enjoying the last evening of our dream.\nProblem is 318 days have passed since that day** and I can barely remember what we did that evening. I know we ended up back at the Shibuya crossing – same place twice in one day in the whole of Tokyo is quite a challenge – and finding food of some sort. Was it Tempura? Or sushi? Or teppanaki? Who knows? Just that it was good and topped off with one of the most expensive half pints of lager we’ve ever had due to a “seating service” of 500Y in the bar we happened upon. Still it was worth it. Look how happy \u0026amp; hairy we are!\n*Note: The first half of this post was written on 29th July 2011. The second half was written extremely slowly over the period since the last blog post. Let it not be said that I never finish anything.\n** this is pure coincidence that I am finishing day 318, 318 days after the occasion. I had no idea. That has hit me hard. That we have been back in the UK for the same length of time as our whole trip minus 1 day. Time is such a weird and wonderful thing. You can fit so much into it if you really try and nothing much if you stop trying.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2012/06/11/day-318-thursday-28th-july-tokyo/","summary":"Today is a sad day.

If that is all the film is then, well, let’s just say it’s not my kind of film.\nHowever, I didn’t think that was what the story was about. I googled around to see if others had come to the same conclusion as me, but no-one had so I figured I’d post my interpretation here.\nI thought at the end you were supposed to realise that the main protagonist, Robert, was the one who had killed everyone. There never were any crazed ASBO ninjas.\nMy reasons:\n The hoodies have no motivation for their killing spree. The start of the film is all about his crumbling mental state. His paranoia about unstoppable violent youths. He hits his daughter, he’s losing it. People get killed just after he leaves (like the librarian). When he was with the security guard and they see a hoody, I assume Robert was going mental, schizophrenic style. The guard says something like “leave us alone” which could have referred to him and the daughter, not him and Robert. The guard then locks the door against him. Robert isn’t killed at this point even though he’s looking through the door for ages and they’re uber-fast freaking ninjas. At the end I assumed Robert thinks he’s stabbing a hoody, but actually went a bit nuts again and stabbed his daughter. At the very end, and his daughter sees her mum’s car, she wants to get out and find her mum. Perhaps she meant that they should stop her seeing the bodies, or that she wanted her mum to take her to the hospital.  Obviously I’m probably completely wrong since no-one else has come to this conclusion and I’m rubbish at understanding films. Heck, when I saw the 6th sense I was practically in the cinema car park before I twigged what it was about. Anyway, I don’t really care. That’s what I think it was about and that helps make the film better for me!\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/blog/2012/03/04/f-the-movie-is-everyone-stupid-or-is-it-just-me/","summary":"Spoiler Alert – This will ruin the film if you haven’t seen it.\nF\nThis film started great, a teacher tangled in red tape, falls into depression and alcohol etc etc. But then these supernatural hooded psychos spring into the film and start killing everyone.

If like me you’ve never heard of them:\n parkrun organise free, weekly, 5km timed runs around the world. They are open to everyone, free, and are safe and easy to take part in.\n Pretty simple really. You just register for free on the website for a personal barcode, print it out then turn up and race. You just register as a runner, not for individual races, it’s up to you which races you attend.\nThe parkrun in Bristol is held in Ashton Court, a pretty simple out-and-back course that takes you up a hill then back down it.\nThe races starts at 9am so I left the house a little late at 8:40 but thought I’d be ok. I underestimated how rubbish my bike is, how strong the wind was and how slow I am. It too me 22 minutes of flat-out cycling to get to the start line. Luckily the race started 5 minutes late so I was able to join in (heart still beating like mad!).\nAs usual, I started near the front over-filled with optimism. Half way up the climb my pace slows to a crawl and I realise I left all my optimism at the start line. I plod on.\nAt the half way point of the course you’re at the top of the park and turn back on yourself. Panoramic views of Bristol spread before you and you realise it’s all downhill from here. The optimism has caught me up and I smile. I probably look like a complete idiot when I run downhill, bouncing with huge lanky strides. I don’t care, it feels great, I love running downhill. The wind is also on my back and it just feels like flying. I start picking off the people that overtook me on the climb. Clap clap, my feet pound the path picking up dangerous speeds. This can’t be good for my bones. It doesn’t even feel like hard work, I can feel my heart rate dropping. Did I mention I love running downhill?\nIf you’re expecting me to say I won the thing, well, I was nowhere near. I guess I finished about 30th and I forgot to stop my watch so don’t really know what my time was (although it’ll be on the website later). That doesn’t matter though, it was a good, fun race. Well, I say it doesn’t matter but I’m far too competitive to leave it there. I wonder if I can get into the top 20 before the end of the month… 😉\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/blog/2012/03/03/my-first-parkrun/","summary":"Today I ran my first parkrun.

As I’ve mentioned before, I get asked what camera to buy a lot. I mean loads, it’s silly. Generally, I get asked by people who are fed up with the blurry, grainy photos they are currently taking and think a new camera will solve everything. If this sounds like you, then go read my previous post about whether or not an SLR is for you.\nDone? Still interested? Excellent…\nFor entry-level, buy new In that post I suggested that buying second hand may be a good way to go. Well, I just had a rummage around eBay, and although I would recommend it for buying more expensive second hand pro stuff, the entry level stuff seems to hold its price a lot better. So much so that most of what I saw is now better specced brand new for the same money. When buying entry-level equipment, I suggest you buy new. Sleep easy knowing that you’ll probably be able to sell it for a decent price should you choose to upgrade in a few years.\nManufacturer lock-in The first choice to make is between Canon and Nikon (some argue Sony but I wouldn’t). Lenses and flashes are generally not interchangeable between brands, so whichever one you pick, you’re kinda stuck with forever. (I’m on team Canon, but Nikon also make awesome stuff). Don’t stress about it too much, it doesn’t matter, flip a coin.\nMy favourite After looking around, my recommendation is the Canon 1100D. It is a cracking little camera. Packing great bang for buck, it also shoots HD video. It’s just dropped in price on Amazon for some reason, so I think it’s an absolute bargain.\n£310 – Camera body + kit lens (18-55mm)\nThe kit lens is a great all-rounder and worth a good £100 on it’s own.\nExtra lens If you’re feeling flush, the first lens you should buy is a no-brainer (in my humble opinion).\n£77 – 50mm lens. The “nifty-fifty”\nThis lens is amazing and dirt cheap. In my short experience, you normally have to spend £300 before you can get a lens that is worth having. This one bucks that trend by producing the best photos you’ve ever taken.\nWarning: It has no zoom at all. None. Nada. Zip. If you want to zoom in or out you have to walk. It sounds pretty crazy but it’s worth it for the picture quality. It’s f1.8 which means it practically sees in the dark and takes prints that look like they belong in a magazine. Bear in mind this lens is perfect for taking portraits, baby photos etc. but no good for anything wider like landscapes. I find landscapes boring anyway. Being a “fast” lens means you’ll be able to take sharper images (same bright image in faster shutter time) which is handy for fast moving kids.\nFilm Memory You’ll need a memory card, I always choose memory cards in this order:\nBrand – for reliability\nSpeed – don’t buy a slow one\nSize – your budget will decide this\nThere’s no point putting a link for this, prices change by the minute, just have a shop around. Perhaps you already have one lying around in an old camera/phone/wii…\nGood luck Even though this equipment is described as “entry-level” don’t let that put you off. Seriously, you’ll take photos so good you’ll grin from ear to ear. You’ll show your friends and they’ll compliment you on what a great photographer you are. Six months later you’ll look back at those photos with a harsh and critical eye and be surprised at how amateur they were. Congratulations, you’re on your slippery way to an expensive but rewarding hobby.\nIf you take this advice, be sure to post a link to your flickr / Google+ photos page in the comments below. 😉\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/blog/2012/02/27/my-recommendation-for-your-first-slr-in-2012/","summary":"Want better photos?

Easy.\nThe one thing that bugs me though is that they’ve swapped “expected” and “actual” parameter arguments around for the equality test. Technically it’s not that important since it won’t affect the result of the test, but in practice I think it’s very important. Your tests form part of your documentation of how the code should behave.

If so, I hope this post helped you out.\n Current T-Mobile customers: If (like me) you are already a T-Mobile customer then the checkout procedure will fail right at the end with an error code “existing customer“. I went into the tesco mobile shop and was told that the only way around it was to switch to a PAYG contract, then try again. This was a bit of a pain and I won’t bore you with the series of contradicting advice I got from T-Mobile on the matter. If you’re a T-Mobile customer, you have to do the following:\n Buy a PAYG sim card (I got one for £11.99 with £10 credit from Three but you can get cheaper). Ring T-Mobile. Tell them you wish to cancel. Also request a Porting Authorisation Code (PAC) so that you can keep my number. Your account isn’t actually closed until the number is ported. Contact your PAYG sim network to port your number. For Three there is an online form under “Bringing your number to Three”. Once your number has been ported onto your PAYG sim (mine took 1 day) you can order your phone from Tesco.  There are a few quirks with the tesco order form. For example, entering a landline number is mandatory and a mobile number is not accepted. I just made up a number and it still worked. Also, it asked me to enter my name as it appears on the card (MR M J BURNS) but then complained that my first name was too short. I entered both my initials in the firstname box and that worked.\nAlternatives The Google Nexus is the new kid on the block but costs big bucks at the moment. There’s also an upgraded Galaxy S2 in the form of the Galaxy S2 HD LTE floating around Japan. Don’t get too excited though, this isn’t coming to the UK for ages and there’s no foreseeable plans for a decent rollout of a 4G network in the UK for quite a while anyway. You should also consider if you can afford to commit to 24 months for a phone that won’t make your life any better/easier/happier. It’s just a phone. Pah, who am I kidding, it’s a work of art and object of pure desire!\nConclusion Getting your hands on this Tesco deal can be a bit of hassle, but when you look at the savings over 24 months, completely worth it.\nI hope this helps you if you’re in the market for a top smartphone.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/blog/2011/12/07/the-cheapest-way-to-get-a-samsung-galaxy-s2-in-the-uk/","summary":"If you’re a materialistic idiot like me, you’ll be interested in how you can get your hands on a disgustingly extravagant smartphone while parting with the least amount of cash possible.\nThe best deal I found for the Galaxy S2 (by far) has been through Tesco:\n Free handset T-Mobile network 300 mins/300 texts 24 month contract Free delivery 500MB Data Booster + Unlimited Internet £20 of free apps available (through some T\u0026amp;Cs) £20.","title":"The cheapest way to get a Samsung Galaxy S2 in the UK"},{"content":"This is it, our final adventure of the trip. We’ve ridden camels across the desert, boated up the Ganges, hiked along the Nepalese border, zip-lined across waterfalls, trodden through jungle with elephants, tandem-navigated vineyards, thrown ourselves out of a plane and off a cable-car, crashed a campervan, scuba-dived in the Great Barrier Reef, seen the Taj Mahal, the Petronas Towers, Angkor Wat \u0026amp; the Sydney Opera House. Now we’re off to climb 6km through the night to reach the summit of Mt Fuji, the highest mountain in Japan, in time for sunrise.\nAfter picking up our small backpacks from K’S House we made it to the bus station with just enough time to fuel up on carbs from Burger King before catching the 19:30 bus to Fuji 5th station.\nIt was dark when we neared Fuji so we couldn’t see what was outside but we knew we must have been travelling higher and higher as our ears started to pop. When we arrived at the 5th station at 22:15 it was actually a little chilly, a feeling we hadn’t had for a week or so.\nWe were expecting crowds of walkers but the bus was barely a quarter full and only a few people were loitering around the station. There was just one building with lights on which housed the loos, lockers, essential supplies and obligatory souvenirs.\nOur flip-flops \u0026amp; shorts just weren’t going to cut it so we changed into our trusty hiking gear – trainers plus cotton trousers \u0026amp; thermals (me) / jeans (matt) – and headed out into the night.\nWell we walked out the door and had no idea where to go. There seemed to be no indication of where the trail began. Good start.\nOur detective skills failed us, we gave in and asked someone where to go. Luckily one of the sparse hikers pointed us in the right direction and we finally found the start point. Look!\nAnd the Yoshida Trail route looked simple on the map…It was 22:27:57 and off we went in a light drizzle of rain into the darkness.\nThe trail was wide and level, if not descending slightly, for half a kilometre. This is easy we thought. Then it veered right and upwards and we realised it might not be all plain sailing. We were walking over rocks and mud with only a head torch for me and a hand torch for Matt to light the way.\nEarly on we passed through a concrete tunnel with speakers and an eerie voice repeating that you should not take this route lightly. Do not wear summer clothes or shoes. Be properly prepared. Were we entering the twilight zone? Should we continue?\nAh sod it, it can’t be that bad.\nHalf an hour of walking and we had 5.3km left. 8 mins later and only 5km left. So far so good.\n 23:08 – 5.0km /343 mins to go\n  23:30 – 4.3km / 320 mins to go\n  23:57 – 3.8km / 295 mins to go\n At 3.8km to go, the sign’s estimated time was 295mins. For anyone who can’t divide that by 60 that’s pretty much 5 hours. 5 hours??? To go less than 4km. Surely not. But we were going at a pace similar to the estimates on the posts so it seemed plausible.\nThe path was wide again and zig-zagged quite steeply. We looked back over our shoulder and could see the twinkling lights of the nearest town far below in the distance. Above more twinkling lights of torches as other walkers ascended before us.\nWe were starting to tire a little now so stopped for water and nibbles. It surprised us how the altitude was getting to both of us so quickly. We were hoping there was a station coming up soon as we needed a sit-down.\nThere seemed to be light up ahead which was a good sign and then we saw the good sign of the 7th station at 00:10.\nThe station consisted of wooden huts which we couldn’t go into as you have to pay, a tuck shop and expensive toilets (200yen). Plus much needed long benches for resting on our laurels.\n 00:15 – 3.4km / 273min to go\n  00:23 – 3.2km / 262min to go\n 00:31 We came across a station that was neither 7th or 8th so possibly 7.5th station.It was a little soggy, or should I say we were a little soggy, by this point. But still chirpy 2 hours into the hike.\n 00:37 – 3.1km / 255 mins to go\n 01:01 We reach another station, possibly the 8th station, 3,020m or 3100m high we weren’t sure as two signs said two different things. 01:09 – leave to head onwards \u0026amp; upwards – 2.7km / 195mins to go\n  01:34 – 2.0km / 140mins to go\n 01:36 This is the 8th Station, we think. There are plenty of people hanging around here, trying to keep warm. We prop ourselves on a bench, lean back, cover and faces and have a snooze for a while.\n01:50 Now at an altitude of 3,250m. 01:53 1.8km / 125 mins to go\n  02:07 1.4km / 83 mins to go\n Perhaps we were at version 2 of the 8th station, who knows, but we decided to take a longer break as didn’t want to get to the summit too early Sunrise wasn’t due for another 2.5hours and we only had 1hour 23 mins according to the sign.\nThe wind had picked up, the temperature had dropped and the rain was pelting down now as we managed to find a semi-sheltered bench at the side of the station to wait for a while.\nAs we sat there we realised there were an awful lot of people passing us all of a sudden. Where were they coming from. We ought to get moving so we don’t get stuck behind too many of them.\n 02:50 1.3km / 80 mins to go\n Unfortunately there were many many people on the mountain now and the pace was slowing.\n 03:07 3450m high – 900m / 60mins to go\n At this point we were ascending at a snail’s pace. The guided groups had come out of their sleeping huts and started climbing all at the same time. It was gridlock. The track became slimmer and dodgier. In places we were scrambling in between large rocks with limp rope to hold onto. It was frustrating to have sat for 30mins at 8th station thinking it better to wait when we would have been better off getting to the top as soon as possible to avoid freezing to death in a queue on the side of the mountain.\nWith the crowds you could see how differently people had prepared for this, or not, in some cases. We saw one guy in three quarter length trousers and crocs. No socks, bare feet in those plastic shoes with holes in. Insane.\nThere was another man in front with his two young daughters, none dressed for wet weather or hiking in particular and no torches. The girls were crying and dad was promising they could stop at the 9th station.\nTurns out 9th station had collapsed and was no more. We don’t know what happened to them. We overtook as often as possible, even if that meant going off piste a little and pissing some people off. I had come too far to let a traffic jam stop me from getting to the top for sunrise.\nBy 04:38 the weather was pretty harsh…\n…but the end was in sight as we reached the Torii gate…\n… and not long after the 10th and final station at the top of Mt Fuji! Hooray!\nIt was 04:46. It had taken 6 hours and 18 mins to climb and it was absolutely bloody freezing.\nThey say the coldest time of the day is just before sunrise and they, whoever they are, are not darn wrong.\nBefore doing anything else our survival instincts were to cram ourselves into a corner of a shelter to thaw a little.\nMatt unfortunately for him had to pop out again so braved the cold air again to find the atrociously expensive basic loo (300yen) as I stood defrosting next to the stoves cooking canned drinks in large metal vats.\nBeing just about able to our fingers, Matt held up our souvenir banner smiling through gritted teeth with the “sunrise view” from the top of Fuji behind him.\nAt 05:03 we persuaded some other poor bugger to use our camera to take these spectacular pics. We wanted proof we’d been to the top. This is more proof of the terrible weather conditions but also that we were both still awake after over 6 hours of hiking.\nAlthough we’d taken almost a working day in time to get up the mountain we were both keen to start descending as soon as possible.\nWe made our way through the hoards and found two tracks. One going down and one going… yes up.\nWe weren’t quite at the summit. That appeared to be a little further on around the volcanic crater. Matt was enthusiastic about finishing it. I wanted to too as we’d come all that way but the chill factor was getting to me.\nDeciding to go for it we braced ourselves and fought against the icy head wind along a eerily quiet narrow track that wound its way in a foggy direction that no-one else seemed to be going in. After 5 mins we couldn’t see much of anything as we were blinded by the blustery rain and I had run out of steam. I didn’t fancy falling down the crater and no-one knowing we were there so regrettably we turned back and went downwards like the rest of the crazy people.\nOff we all trundled down through the fog. At one point we reached a fork in the track and no-one seemed to know which direction to go in. Groups were waiting for other groups and some were going one way and others another way. There were no signposts that made any sense. So we took a chance on the downhill rather than the across the mountain direction and continued on our way overtaking the rainbow of hikers.\nThen at 06:25 the cloud cover began to clear…\n06:29 then it came back 06:40 Only 4.7km / 150 mins to go 06:44 and it cleared again\n06:48 we took a rest and to take in the views as going downhill felt like harder work than up. The incline was steeper and the red clay soil was soft underfoot and was like walking through sand. Others taking a well deserved rest too\n 07:21 A 20 minute queue for the loo halfway down a mountain. Can’t beat the views. Shame about the eco loos which were so disgusting I can’t write any more as want to erase it from my memory. Perhaps it was more shocking because we were in Japan one of the most advanced and cleanest countries on the planet. If you’re ever on Mt Fuji and can wait another hour the next loos are slightly better and you won’t have to cross your legs forever and a day.\n07:45 Look how wide awake we look, how long Matt’s beard has grown and how white my hair has become all in 9hours!07:59 The views are getting better and better\n08:13 Breakfast stop of sushi balls 08:23 Good stuff 08:28 Almost back 08:50 and we made it! And do you know what? I forgot to take a darn photo! Curses!\nOur bus back had been booked for 11:00 but we were able to queue at the bus ticket office and change them to 10:00 which meant only a short wait sat on the pavement at 5th station.\nAs we sat there bus loads of walkers arrived ready for their trip up the mountain (and as we had neared the bottom we’d passed other people on their way up), we thought how great it was to have done it and be on the way back rather than at the beginning not knowing what was in store.\nBack in Tokyo by 12:30 it felt like another world and it had all been a dream.\n So after a generally negative blog, what did we really think of Fuji-san? We have never been so cold in our lives. We thought Sandakphu was chilly. That was tropical compared to this. Our lungs compressed until we could hardly breathe, our hands were so numb we couldn’t put our gloves on properly without using our teeth, we were soaked to the bone, tired out, aching limbs, too many people and there was nothing to see at the top.\nBUT it is one of the best experiences we’ve had of this entire trip.

Anyone who reads this may think why the hell am I bothering when it was so long ago. But it is something I know I must do and I want to do.

Food was priority, no change there. Came across another one of those vending machine places, this time it was outside. We stood for a while staring at the machine trying to work out which kanji matched which picture and hoped we’d chosen a different soup each to try \u0026amp; some gyoza dumplings to share before trying to confirm it with a bewildered looking businessman who was patiently waiting in line.\nWe entered the establishment through those strips of plastic you get on large refrigerated areas and found ourselves in a long narrow room with just 6 stools along a breakfast bar facing the cooks. We handed over our tickets with confidence – our smiles saying yes we’ve done this before – and pulled up a stool. One each, not both on the same stool, that would be silly.\nOne of the cooks started chatting to the businessman who had followed us in and a few seconds later he was presenting us with two glasses of water he’d poured for us from the water tank in the corner, before getting himself a glass and pulling up the stool next to me.\nThe dumplings came (phew, we had ordered correctly) and we proceeded to pour soya sauce into our bowls. Our slave of a businessman immediately gestured that was a mistake and passed us the correct bottle containing soya sauce. Our confidence faded but we were grateful for the advice as the former bottle held some sweet sickly sauce that would never have co-ordinated with gyozas.\nNext up were our soups. Turns out our different soups weren’t as different as we’d imagined. They were exactly the same pork \u0026amp; noodle soup except Matt had super-sized his. Ah well it was super tasty so who cares.\nWe walked out in a more sheepish mood but tummies filled minus the Japan book we’d “borrowed” from the hostel. So Matt had to put in another appearance and I think they were glad to get rid of us.\nSpent the remainder of the afternoon nosing around Asakusa, stopping a little longer at the famous and pretty impressive Sensō-ji temple around the corner that we’d pretty much ignored previously.\nAll temples have a water fountain from which to wash your hands and face, and sometimes drink.\nAround another corner old meets new with the Asahi Beer Hall, part of Asahi breweries. Unfortunately we didn’t have time to pop by for a brewery tour.\nFollowed by shopping, in an area of Tokyo that is gone from my memory, on a mission to find a head torch for tonight’s climb.\nMission accomplished in a random bag shop with the sweetest guy who couldn’t do enough to help us.\nNow we’re fully prepared for a night on a mountain… *cough*\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/11/16/day-317-wednesday-27th-july-tokyo/","summary":"This may say this blog post is for 27th July but I am trying to write it up on 7th November, 103 days after the occasion so please accept my apologies for the tediousness.\nI have no idea why Japan has taken me so long to write about and how I made time whilst travelling to write up the rest of the travels is a weird one.

Our final trip on the Shinkansen and I think we have got our money’s worth.\nBased on Google maps we did a total of 1104 miles which is about ¥25 per mile (approx 20p). That’s cheaper than our old RX-8 (when we were materialistic and had money to spend on silly cars).\nIn detail for anyone who likes this kind of stuff, like me, the distances were Tokyo –\u0026gt; Hiroshima (507 miles), Hiroshima –\u0026gt; Miyajima (16 miles), Miyajima –\u0026gt; Hiroshima (16 miles), Hiroshima –\u0026gt; Kyoto (224 miles), Kyoto –\u0026gt; Nara (26 miles), Nara –\u0026gt; Kyoto (26 miles), Kyoto –\u0026gt; Tokyo (289 miles).\nArriving back at K’s House Tokyo Oasis we dumped the bags and decided to head to the baseball. Neither of us know anything about baseball but it seems a popular sport over here so we thought why not?\nWalking out of Korakuen tube station, a fairly central stop in Tokyo, you are met with a gigantic roller-coaster.\nThen you spot the Tokyo Dome and that is a monster of a building. A 55,000 seater stadium specifically for baseball. Wow.\nWe had been correctly informed by K’s House that we could obtain tickets once we got there. There were a range of tickets and us being on a tight budget we opted for the cheapest – standing room only – the assumption being it would be like at a football match where you get a stepped terrace to loiter on.\nThat was an incorrect assumption. You know when you’re at a stadium and you can wander along at the top of the seated areas to buy food \u0026amp; drink, this is the standing area. You find a space along the edge and lean on the barriers.\nIt was fun though. We didn’t really mind as we didn’t have to move at all. They had plenty of beer girls running up and down the steps with the keenest eyesight. The moment you raised you hand an inch one would come skipping up between the seats and pour you a pint of Kirin or Asahi. Matt suddenly loved baseball.\nOur view from our spot by the pillar.\nMatt wished he’d invested in some quality binoculars when the mid-innings entertainment came out on the pitch.\nIt’s difficult to tell from this photo but the crowd were mental. And not just crazy pockets of people like at football who start off a song and then others join in, this was mass organisation of chanting. And as soon as play started again they would all stop in unison. In their white and orange jerseys.\nWe think the home side lost. It was difficult to tell seeing as a) everything was in Japanese and b) I don’t understand anything and Matt doesn’t understand enough about baseball to know exactly what was going on. I definitely know I learned that it’s a slower game than I realised. There is a lot of standing around and not as much running as I thought. But it was a fantastic atmosphere and it was good to experience a sport that is obviously loved in Japan. It must be to have that size of stadium in the middle of the capital city!\nHungry as ever we went on an epic tube journey trying to find somewhere to eat. First stop was Roppongi. We headed out of the tube station and found ourselves in a posh apartment/ office block next to a flyover. It didn’t look like the kind of place we would find some food that would suit the kind of people we were looking like in the same clothes we’d lived in for 10 months.\nSo we popped back on the tube and tried Shinjuku instead. This turned out to be a little seedy. Lots of post-work businessmen clogging up the restaurants with randomly dressed girls hanging around the streets. Plus flashing blue lights and sirens going off here there and everywhere.\nI felt a little uncomfortable and grouchy as my rumbling stomach was getting the better of me. As we were about to give up and go back on the tube we spotted a busy fast food joint called Gindaco with guys stood at tables with beer and trays of interesting looking balls of something. It seemed more inviting than the other food places in this area.\nTurns out they were octopus balls. Well balls made of octopus. Called Takoyaki. Smothered in some sauce and cheese eaten with chopsticks.\nThey were delicious. And not just because we were starving by this point.\nMade it back to K’s and found we’d missed the free drinks evening they do every Tuesday by about 4 hours. On the plus side they’d left some of the free booze on the table so we sat and drank dodgy red wine and sake out of juice cartons whilst making paper cranes.\nThis is Matt’s example of his origami skills. Mine was shameful.\nLooking forward to a lie-in tomorrow as next on the agenda is Mount Fuji…\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/11/16/day-316-tuesday-26th-july-kyoto-tokyo-tokyo-dome-baseball/","summary":"Back to Tokyo again today.

The only thing I wanted to cover was that if you really want a singleton, I recommend you use the enum pattern. This post was motivated after more interesting comments were raised about testability when you see the “static” keyword.\nWhen you type “static” a little alarm bell should ring in your head to warn you that there could be trouble ahead. As Dan correctly pointed out, a reference to the static member INSTANCE will tightly couple the caller to Elvis. This is not good if testing with Elvis will cause you problems. For example, if Elvis is slow, or accesses a database or something like that which would be better tested with a mock implementation.\nHowever, sometimes the static keyword makes sense because it is an implementation detail that you are not concerned with. By you I mean a client of the code. Why muddy an API so that you can pass around objects that will never change. To illustrate my point, I wrote a very simple bit of code that hopefully isn’t too contrived.\nImagine you have to write a computer system for a Blackpool nightclub called “Elvis Live!”. This club has a different Elvis impersonator on every night. The system has to manage the bookings of the different Elvis impersonators and print the posters which list which impersonators are performing each night.\nIn my very simple implementation I wrote a class to represent the club: ElvisClub.java\npackage uk.co.mattburns.elvis;\rimport java.util.Map;\rimport org.joda.time.LocalDate;\rimport com.google.common.collect.Maps;\rpublic class ElvisClub {\rprivate final Map\u0026amp;lt;LocalDate, ElvisImpersonator\u0026gt; bookings = Maps\r.newTreeMap();\rpublic boolean bookImpersonator(LocalDate date,\rElvisImpersonator impersonator) {\rif (bookings.containsKey(date)) {\rreturn false;\r} else {\rbookings.put(date, impersonator);\rreturn true;\r}\r}\rpublic ElvisImpersonator getImpersonatorOnDate(LocalDate date) {\rreturn bookings.get(date);\r}\rpublic String getPosterTitle() {\rreturn \u0026quot;Keeping The King Alive since \u0026quot; + Elvis.INSTANCE.died();\r}\rpublic String getPosterBody() {\rStringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();\rfor (LocalDate date : bookings.keySet()) {\rElvisImpersonator act = bookings.get(date);\rstringBuilder.append(date.toString() + \u0026quot; : See \u0026quot; + act.name());\rstringBuilder.append(\u0026quot; who was born \u0026quot; + act.yearsBornAfterElvis()\r+ \u0026quot; years after Elvis\u0026quot;);\r}\rreturn stringBuilder.toString();\r}\r}\rA simple pojo to represent a performer at the club: ElvisImpersonator.java\npackage uk.co.mattburns.elvis;\rimport org.joda.time.LocalDate;\rpublic class ElvisImpersonator {\rprivate final String name;\rprivate final LocalDate birthdate;\rpublic ElvisImpersonator(String name, LocalDate birthdate) {\rthis.name = name;\rthis.birthdate = birthdate;\r}\rpublic String name() {\rreturn name;\r}\rpublic LocalDate birthdate() {\rreturn birthdate;\r}\rpublic int yearsBornAfterElvis() {\rreturn birthdate().getYear() - Elvis.INSTANCE.born().getYear();\r}\r}\rCrucially, both of these classes have a dependency on Elvis. I decided to make Elvis a singleton: Elvis.java\npackage uk.co.mattburns.elvis;\rimport org.joda.time.LocalDate;\rpublic enum Elvis {\rINSTANCE;\rprivate final LocalDate born = new LocalDate(1935, 1, 8);\rprivate final LocalDate died = new LocalDate(1977, 8, 16);\rpublic LocalDate born() {\rreturn born;\r}\rpublic LocalDate died() {\rreturn died;\r}\r}\rYou can browse all the source code here. Or better still, checkout the code and simply import the project into eclipse:\nsvn checkout http://elvis-club.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ elvis-club-read-only\r I already know what you’re thinking:\n Elvis.java should be an interface: Celebrity.java. Then I could have a concrete Elvis to pass around which implements Celebrity.\n  ElvisImpersonator.java should be an interface: Impersonator.java. Then I could write a CelebrityImpersonator.java which would take a Celebrity on construction.\n That is one way of solving it, and it’s not a bad way. I agree that you should expect change, embrace it, marry it, have its babies, but don’t start writing code for it before it’s happened. One day the club may have a Marilyn Monroe night and in that case you anticipated change beautifully luckily. What if it changes into a comedy club? How about a restaurant?\nWhat’s really important is writing code that’s easy for programmers to read, and therefore, easy for programmers to change.\nHere is a snippet from some of my test code which gives you an idea of what I mean:\nElvisClub theClub = new ElvisClub();\rLocalDate today = new LocalDate();\rLocalDate brianBorn = new LocalDate(1970, 1, 1);\rElvisImpersonator brian = new ElvisImpersonator(\u0026quot;Brian\u0026quot;, brianBorn);\rtheClub.bookImpersonator(today, brian);\rA similar snippet, without using the Elvis singleton would look something like this:\nLocalDate brianBorn = new LocalDate(1970, 1, 1);\rLocalDate elvisBorn = new LocalDate(1935, 1, 8);\rLocalDate elvisDied = new LocalDate(1977, 8, 16);\rCelebrity realElvis = new CelebrityImpl(\u0026quot;Elvis\u0026quot;, elvisBorn, elvisDied);\rImpersonator brian = new CelebrityImpersonator(\u0026quot;Brian\u0026quot;, realElvis, brianBorn);\rClub theClub = new Club(realElvis);\rtheClub.bookImpersonator(today, brian);\rThere’s not a massive difference but I still think the constructors are a bit “noisy”. In a real-world application, you would probably expect references to a more complex set of collaborating objects.\nI haven’t sacrificed any testibility of my code. If anything, I’ve reduced the amount of code I need to test. My way, there can only be Elvis and so I only need to test that the club handles things to do with Elvis. If I wrote a more generic version I would have to test that it handles Celebrities that are still alive, that they were born before they died, and so on.\nI think I’m right but I’ve changed software design views pretty frequently over the last 10 years. If you think I’m wrong, I challenge you to convince me why…\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/blog/2011/11/14/simplify-your-api/","summary":"I recently wrote an article about singletons in java.

Today was the latter.\nStill determined to do everything we planned we set off to catch a bus to the temples in north-western Kyoto. Little did we know that a) there were no bus stops for half a mile \u0026amp; b) we’d have to wait in the searing sun for 20mins for a bus \u0026amp; c) we’d get on the wrong bus \u0026amp; d) it would take 40mins to get to the nearest point to the temples. However we managed to get a day ticket, jump off at the right place to get another bus to the temple.\nIt took a little longer again as we stood in what we thought was a queue for the second bus only for it to turn up, everyone get on and it to leave without us. How could that possibly happen you may ponder? Turns out the elderly guy in front of us was just waiting and waiting and as he didn’t get on the bus neither did we. Oh how we laughed!\nFinally a bus came that took us in the right direction and 10 mins later we were at the university, the nearest stop. Turns out it’s at least another 10 min walk to the temple. I am so glad that it was a Zen temple. We needed the power of Zen to relax and calm us after that epic journey.\nAnd was it worth the trip? Well this one, the Ryoan-ji temple was not as impressive as we had hoped. The gardens were pretty and the wildlife were cool – orange spotted coy carp and herons. The Zen garden inside the temple was bizarre. A peaceful garden of 15 rocks surrounded by white gravel. The belief is that whatever direction you look at it from you can never see all 15 without reaching “enlightenment”. We thought we could see all 15 so perhaps we became enlightened quickly.\nDidn’t feel so enlightened when we got told off for going through the wrong door into the temple. We’d walked the wrong way around the grounds without realising which meant we encountered the groups door first. So when we returned to pick up our shoes they were no longer where we’d left them. Instead they were on full display in the naughty corner. How disgraceful were we not giving in our ticket we’d paid a ridiculous amount for at the gate. The stroppy lady on the counter put a bit of a dampener on the experience of visiting a Zen temple and made us feel like it was purely there for the tourist income rather than the spiritual purpose it undoubtedly had been built for 6 centuries ago. Such a shame as 99% of the people we’ve met so far have been lovely.\nNext stop was Kinkaku-ji temple, a much more impressive structure, completely covered in gold leaf which reflected \u0026amp; glimmered in the surrounding lake. This photo does not do it justice.\n The gardens were lovely to walk around too and we wish we’d had more time to wander.\nBy some miracle we managed to get the right bus which took us directly to Kyoto station. This meant we could get on the next train to Osaka and we arrived before 15:00 when the parade was due to start.\nWe were starving but all we could find was a Starbucks so our lame budget afforded us a large coffee to share. We looked like freaks. The whole place was packed with people drinking iced coffee and there we were with our steaming latte, in the middle of Japanese summer.\nWe headed through the streets of Osaka to find the festival parade route. One thing that fascinated us about Japanese cities was the amount of businesses that could be squeezed into one building. You would often see a sign outside a 6 storey building with 15 different logos. This one had to be a record though surely.\nThis wasn’t part of the parade. It was just a white van that passed us and I liked it.\nWe found a shaded spot on a bridge under a flyover that seemed a good place to pitch ourselves to watch the procession.\nIt was 15:30 by now and there were teeny hints of a parade with a couple of police here and there.\nAs we stood sweltering in the humidity we eyed up the fans that many passers-by were holding wishing I’d brought my Miyajima fan with us. It seemed odd that so many people had similar looking fans I thought I’d go off and investigate.\nI finally found her and Matt was gutted he’d not offered to go himself when he saw the photo she was happy for me to take of her. 😀\nFinally at 16:15 there were signs the Osaka Tenjin Matsuri festival had begun.\nAnd I’m not denying we didn’t think why did we come all this way when the only guys to walk by for 15 mins were looking bored, sweaty \u0026amp; having a smoke…\nWe moved position to a kerb by the river and things looked up… Funny guy on horseback, check. Traditional shopping trolley, check.\nThen more \u0026amp; more interesting characters filled the street.\nAnd that was the parade over and done with. Next were the boats, but that couldn’t be done on an empty stomach. We pushed the boat out (ahem) with a pot of edamame, a hot dog \u0026amp; two beers from a riverside bar before settling on a great grassy spot at the end of the island in the middle of Yodo river to watch the boat procession. Every person that had been in the parade had piled into the barges ready for a trip down the river. Hundreds and hundreds of people covered at least 20 boats, some sitting quietly, others eating, drinking and partying.\nThe finale of the festival is a big fireworks display which we had a cat’s chance in hell getting anywhere near. The main bridges were either closed or heaving with people. We wandered aimlessly along roads trying to get closer and the best view we could find was from behind the train tracks. Matt got some great shots of whizzing trains \u0026amp; overhead planes.\nAll in all a very pleasant day and we even managed to get back to Kyoto the same evening.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/10/28/day-315-monday-25th-july-kyoto-osaka-ryoan-ji-kinkaku-ji-temples-tenjin-matsuri-festival/","summary":"We hadn’t planned on going to Osaka as we didn’t think we would have enough time but the guy at the hostel mentioned there would be a big festival there today starting at 3pm so we felt we should go and have a look.\nThe thing is we had also been recommended some other temples in Kyoto and tomorrow we’re off back to Tokyo so we had to get up early to get it all in.","title":"Day 315 Monday 25th July – Kyoto \u0026 Osaka – Ryoan-ji \u0026 Kinkaku-ji temples + Tenjin Matsuri festival"},{"content":"I had the following html in my form:\n\u0026lt;label for=\u0026quot;email-input\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Email\u0026lt;/label\u0026gt; \u0026amp;lt;input id=\u0026quot;email-input\u0026quot; type=\u0026quot;text\u0026quot; title=\u0026quot;Don't worry, your email will not be displayed on the website or given to anyone else.

Often described as an “anti-pattern”. I think it’s a little unfair since I find them pretty useful in several situations. However, the reason they can be bad is important to understand:\n Making a class a singleton can make it difficult to test its clients, as it’s impossible to substitute a mock implementation for a singleton unless it implements an interface that serves as its type.\n That quote, and most of what I am about to write are completely stolen from Josh Bloch’s excellent book, Effective Java (highly recommended in paperback or kindle editions). Those are affiliate links, but I still recommend you buy it no matter where you get it from.\nAnyway, it raises an important point about testability, but one that I think doesn’t matter. The way I see it, if you’re writing a singleton that represents something you want to swap with a mock, such as a database connection or network resource etc then your design will change as your tests evolve. You practice TDD right? You’ll soon realise that a singleton doesn’t make sense or you need an interface of some kind. This post is about how to write a good singleton.\nIn the bad old days before java 1.5 there were 2 common ways to implement a singleton. A public final field:\npublic static final Elvis INSTANCE = new Elvis(); or a static factory:\nprivate static final Elvis INSTANCE = new Elvis(); public static Elvis getInstance() { return INSTANCE; } The static factory version is slightly better in that the you have a bit more flexibility to change your implementation details at a later date. In my two examples there is no performance benefit of either technique in modern JVMs. This is all well and good. There is only one Elvis in the world. There is the possibility a privileged client can invoke the private constructor reflectively but I’m not going to dwell on that.\nBloch raises another problem:\n To make a singleton class that is implemented using either of the previous approaches serializable, it is not sufficient merely to add implements Serializable to its declaration. To maintain the singleton guarantee, you have to declare all instance fields transient and provide a readResolve method. Otherwise, each time a serialized instance is deserialized, a new instance will be created, leading, in the case of our example, to spurious Elvis sightings.\n Oo-er, this sounds messy. You implied in java 1.5 there’s a better way, please, what is it, I’m desperate!\n// Enum singleton - the preferred approach public enum Elvis { INSTANCE; public void leaveTheBuilding() { ... } } TADA!\n This approach is functionally equivalent to the public field approach, except that it is more concise, provides the serialization machinery for free, and provides an ironclad guarantee against multiple instantiation, even in the face of sophisticated serialization or reflection attacks. While this approach has yet to be widely adopted, a single-element enum type is the best way to implement a singleton.\n Have a little think about it, let it sink in, then run off and replace any singletons in any projects you can get your hands on.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/blog/2011/10/26/how-to-write-singletons-in-java/","summary":"Singletons get a pretty bad press.

Nara Park has as many deer grazing as the Forest of Dean has sheep (and wild boar now apparently) roaming the roads.\nSpotted a guy selling deer biscuits (food for deer not made from deer) in the park and thought that might be a nice idea to feed some sweet gentle deer. Little did I know that they KNOW when you have deer food and they turn into hungry zombie-eyed vicious creatures with head-butting antlers and sharp teeth. As I tried to pull individual biscuits from the pile and feed them to a few nearby deer more and more descended like crazed demons nudging and nipping and biting my backside. Matt stood there laughing and taking photos as I threw the pile on the floor and ran away from them. He didn’t get a chance to feed any himself.\nI now have new found respect for wild animals. Especially wild hungry animals. And it doesn’t matter whether they look as sweet as bambi they are not to be sniffed at.\nThis one was a cutie though 😀\nEnough of deer, we had temples to visit. Toda-ji was first on the list. The world’s largest wooden structure.\n Containing the world’s largest bronze Buddha. On a par with the world’s largest spatula I’d say.\nThey’re trying to raise money to re-tile the roof so we paid a few Yen to have a tile added with our own personal message.\nThey may need to patch up some holes in the supporting pillars too…\nTemple-viewing is hungry work so we stopped for green tea ice-cream near the coy carp pond where hungry deer were loitering. This time they didn’t spot us with food and it was nice being able to laugh at other people being chased for a change.\nWe rode the bikes around the park to several other temples most of which were up and down hills so we were glad of the electric power.\nWe had to whizz round the last few temples, through some pretty woodland with concrete pillars which centuries ago would have been built to hold candles and light the way. They looked like they are still used today.\nHad a time for a super-quick late lunch stop at McDonalds of all places, in the old capital of Japan. Had to be the Teriyaki burger for me. And in optimal time delivered the leccy bikes back with seconds to spare and hopped onto the next train back to Kyoto.\nBack at the hostel it was time for sake \u0026amp; dressing up.\nFor some reason we headed out to Gion again for dinner, forgetting it was really expensive, and somehow thought we could walk it in 20mins but completely misjudged how far it was. Took 50 mins to find anywhere we remotely recognised and so I was a little grumpy from the hunger by then.\nWe struggled to find anywhere cheap enough or open enough until we ended up on the same street as last night’s sushi bar. It was a welcoming little noodle bar and we asked for the menu. The guy smiled at us and directed us towards what looked like a ticket machine with lots of buttons and Japanese writing. You had to put money in, select what you wanted and get token out. This was exciting, it was pot luck!\nWhat came was a bowl of steaming hot noodles with pork cooked to order in a flash. Japanese fast food. Delicious.\n A Geisha in Gion.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/10/14/day-314-sunday-24th-july-kyoto-nara/","summary":"Not content with staying in one place for very long off we popped to Nara, the old capital of Japan from 710 to 784AD, 45 mins on the train from Kyoto.\nThey are revamping the train station so it took us 30 mins to find the bicycle hire place which turned out to be right out of the station instead of left.\nWe intended to hire normal bikes but of course they had electric ones so who could resist?","title":"Day 314 Sunday 24th July – Kyoto \u0026 Nara"},{"content":"It is very very hot today. brought back memories of India \u0026amp; SE Asia, carrying our backpacks through searing sunshine.\nAfter our 3rd visit in as many days to Bakery Roti around the corner from J Hoppers, our favourite supplier of random bakery items, we struggled onto a packed tram with all the shoppers. Stares were a plenty as we blocked the narrow alleyways with our ugly luggage. It was a relief to get onto the cool air-conditioned Shinkansen to Kyoto.\nKyoto feels different to Hiroshima. More old, understandably, and more new. The main train station is a monster. Huge glass building stuffed to the brim with platforms and eateries and escalators and shopping centres.\nIt took us a while to find our next abode and we were hot and sticky in just 15 mins of walking in the humidity.\nHeaded to Gion, the old quarter of Kyoto where there are a lot of temples. Somehow we managed to miss the opening times of most of them but came across the Yasaka-jinja Shrine where we could potter about.\nI insisted we go to a traditional tea making ceremony and we tried En just around the corner from the temples. It is tucked into a tiny side street in Gion and you feel like Harry Potter walking through the wall onto platform 9¾ as the hustle \u0026amp; bustle of the busy modern streets disappear behind and you knock on the door of a small modest wooden building.\nOnce inside the traditional house you’re definitely another world away. We joined two other tourists kneeling on the tatami floor and watched a lady in traditional dress spend 35 minutes explaining the process in such a precise manner she seemed almost robotic. Every utensil and every movement has a meaning. Even the direction in which the tea bowl is held in the hand so that the pattern faces the recipient and then it is turned 3 times. The tea drinker should also hold the cup with the pattern facing outwards so that other people at the ceremony can admire and discuss the cup. We even got to make our own tea using powdered green tea and were given a neat turquoise jelly sweet to complement the tea. It was fascinating. Even Matt enjoyed it.\nLeaving the place you felt like you had been dreaming and had just woken up coming back to reality.\nWe explored more of Gion looking for a tasty restaurant but couldn’t find one to suit our budget in the quirky lantern-lit streets.\nInstead we headed to a more commercial area and the had-to-be-done conveyor belt sushi bar. With queues out the door we had time to be nosey at what the protocol was. Pretty much the usual. Take what you want. Pile up the plates. Get charged per plate. Easy. Plus drink as much green tea as you like and watch the chefs in the centre prepare plate after plate of unusual sushi, hoping your favourite would come around next.\nThese were our favourite – tuna and quail eggs I believe.The couple next to us were hungrier than we were. These plate piles are for 2 people. We only had one pile that high for both of us.After sushi, we went down a teeny staircase to a corridor of an underground bar and had a civilised Irish coffee served in teacups with sugar cubes and dainty silver teaspoons. Late night coffee seems to be a popular past-time in Japan. Would a late night coffee bar work in the UK without being full of lairy folk? Me thinks not.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/10/14/day-313-saturday-23rd-july-kyoto-gion-temples-lanterns-tea-sushi/","summary":"It is very very hot today. brought back memories of India \u0026amp; SE Asia, carrying our backpacks through searing sunshine.\nAfter our 3rd visit in as many days to Bakery Roti around the corner from J Hoppers, our favourite supplier of random bakery items, we struggled onto a packed tram with all the shoppers.

Well as full as can be if you imagine no-one and no-deer there.\nIt was a very cool structure. We had heard you needed to go for high tide to get the reflection and for low tide to be able to walk out to it. We thought we’d missed both. Fortune cookies were again on our side and as we spent the whole afternoon there we were able to see both, more or less.\nSo hold onto your hats this is going to be a Sydney opera house/harbour bridge type blog with hundreds of photos of the same structure but from a squillion different angles / with different features.\nFunny photo, haha.\nThe pagoda on the hill before entering the shrine.\nThe shrine is also pretty funky and is built over the water.\nViews of the torii gate from the shrine.\nNo torii gate on this one but he is a cool dude.Once we’d exhausted looking at the shrine and the torii gate in daylight we manoeuvred ourselves into the blind-covered Omotesando street to seek out sustenance in the form of bar-b-q oysters and a rice burger – rice instead of bread for the burger bun. That was fun trying to eat without falling apart.\nAnd no shopping street in Japan is worth its salt without a Hello Kitty store where I took pleasure browsing through the Hello Kitty watches, Hello Kitty mobile phone charms, Hello Kitty socks, Hello Kitty notebooks, Hello Kitty flasks, Hello Kitty table covers, Hello Kitty in Sesame Street costumes, Hello Kitty with Miyajima deer, Hello Kitty \u0026amp; the torii gate etc, etc whilst Matt squirmed to get out of there.\nThis was my penalty for making him spend so long in there.And this is my revenge for making me kiss a giant plastic Hello Kitty. Matt with the World’s largest spatula (Miyajima is famous for its wooden rice scoops).\nAnother revenge, haha! Unbeknownst to Mr. Burns I caught this rather camp photo with my recent purchase as he day-dreamed about beer.A deer later took a fancy to that same fan and almost ate it whilst we sat watching the sunset over the torii gate. The deer have a keen taste for paper so you are warned by large signs as you exit the ferry terminal to keep all paper articles concealed, especially tickets and passports, as the residents have a knack of pickpocketing important documents when your back is turned.\nWe stayed long enough to watch the sun disappear over the hills of mainland Japan and very pretty and relaxing it was too.\nBy the time the sun was gone and we had to start walking back to the ferry to catch one of the last ones to the mainland the water had more or less disappeared from under the torii gate leaving it a little sad seeped in seaweedy mud.\nBack in Hiroshima we hunted down more Okonomiyaki and had an early night in preparation for our journey up to Kyoto tomorrow.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/10/14/rm-day-312-cont-friday-22nd-july-miyajima-itsukushima-shrine-torii-gate/","summary":"After such a sobering morning we needed a lighter afternoon.\nA tram, train \u0026amp; ferry trip later and we were on Miyajima island, home of the Itsukushima Shrine, its famous floating torii gate and countless tame wild deer always looking for food.\nIt’s a pretty little place with a coastal promenade and one street of cute little shops that even the deer fancied popping into for some retail therapy.\nAt the end of the promenade you get a full view of the torii gate.","title":"Day 312 cont… Friday 22nd July – Miyajima – Itsukushima Shrine \u0026 Torii gate"},{"content":"Spent the morning at the Peace Memorial Museum, a very modern building containing some of the most horrific sights I have ever seen.You are shown information about the lead-up to the day the A-bomb was dropped.

It was a lottery. It had to be dropped. It cost too much money to just not bother. It was chosen based on the fact there were no prisoner of war camps in the area. It was a clear day so that the results could be recorded easily.\nA way to get Japan to surrender. They had no warning of the A-bomb. They surrendered afterwards. I don’t claim to know anything about the Second World War but nothing can justify this.\nThe second part of the exhibition shows the aftermath. The effects of the bomb.\nLooking at the remains of a wall peppered with glass from the force of the blast, a museum guide asked us where we were from and told us about the many many children who had been working outside that day. Digging trenches to prevent fire spreading if bombs were dropped. All completely exposed to the effects of the A-bomb.\nI had to leave halfway through.

Otherwise known as the bullet train, it lives up to its reputation. It was on time and it was zippy. If you try to walk whilst it’s moving you feel like you’re floating and have no control over your core balance. It has a similar feel to a plane. Except with miles more legroom and much better food. We happened to miss the snack lady as she passed so I went up to purchase something from her and she waved me back to my seat. She promptly returned to us and gave us our order of coffee \u0026amp; neatly packaged, uniform sized finger sandwiches with the crusts cut-off together with those wet hand towels for freshening up. Maybe this is what first class is like on British Airways.\nThis wasn’t our train – it was the fastest most expensive Nozomi, not covered by the Japan Rail Pass.\nThis on the other hand was our train and is covered by the Japan Rail Pass – the Hikari Rail Star.\nOutside ,the world of Japan whizzed by silently. Between the track and the sea, towns of high-rise flats and grey office blocks, green hills \u0026amp; temples, houses with that eastern style roofing with ornate edging.\nAfter just 5 hours and one change of train at Shin-Osaka we arrived in Hiroshima, over 500 miles away from Tokyo.\nAfter being crammed into a tram which pottered through the centre of Hiroshima at a 1000th of the pace of the Shinkansen we finally arrived at the traditional Ryoku we hoped to stay at. No-one answered. It was hot \u0026amp; humid \u0026amp; after a long journey we craved a shower. We gave them 10 more minutes and still no answer so had to go for Plan B. J Hoppers hostel. Luckily just around the corner and luckily they had a double room in Japanese style. So we almost got what we were hoping for.\nWe took a wander to get our bearings and found a great little bakery which provided us with good snackettes to eat whilst soaking up some sun in the nearest park. The park happened to be the peace memorial park. The main area impacted by the A-bomb dropped at the end of the Second World War. It is a moving place. Lots of green space as you would imagine from a park with different memorials dotted about.\nIt is surrounded by water and when we walked to the other side we saw the infamous building that was at the epicentre [_cough – Ed_] of the bomb. The A-bomb dome building (originally known as the Hiroshima Prefectural Commercial Exhibition Hall). I’ve seen photographs and pictures of that building many times but seeing it in reality is indescribable. I couldn’t believe we were standing looking at it.\nThe A-domeChildren’s Peace Monument\nThe girl in the monument, Sadako, believed that if she made 1,000 paper cranes she would cure her leukaemia. She died before she had finished so children all over the world, inspired by her story, build cranes and send them to the memorial in many different forms. It is very moving to see.\n\n\nPeace memorial with the names of the all of the victims inside.\nIn the evening after a roof-top beer went on the hunt for the famous Hiroshima speciality dish Okonomiyaki. You sit in front of a giant hot plate watching the chefs fry up batter with bacon and cabbage, served over noodles and smothered in a gooey sauce served in what looks like a deep-pan pizza tray with a trowel. Sounds like a leftover fry-up, looks like a left-over fry-up, tastes like a left-over fry-up. Delicious.\n\n Footnote: Japan Rail Pass information\nFor those of you thinking about going to Japan and wondering about the trains, do it. You MUST apply for a Japan Rail Pass before entering the country as it is only available to non-Japanese visitors or Japanese non-residents. You receive an exchange note which you take to one of the main train stations to, unsurprisingly, exchange for a rail pass. This comes as a folded piece of card with your name and reference. It isn’t very technically advanced and if you lose it you’re stuffed. You cannot get a replacement.\nThere are lots of companies that can order this for you. I believe STA Travel do it. But as we were strapped for time we used an online agency called Japanese Experience based in Paris who were excellent and sent it to our hotel in Tokyo. It cost ¥28000 for one ticket plus £17 delivery charge. This may sound like a lot. It isn’t. A single journey from Tokyo to Hiroshima costs something like ¥18000.\nWe exchanged our note for the Japan Rail Pass at Ueno station. It took about 10 mins as you need to complete a form and wait for them to issue the pass.\nLots more info can be found at Seat61.com.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/10/12/day-311-thursday-21st-july-hiroshima/","summary":"Guess what?

We needn’t have worried (when I say we I mean I as Matt never worries about anything). Most things at the airport were in English as well as Japanese. Then once we were on the first train into Tokyo we were adopted by two lovely ladies who didn’t know each other but who worked out between them where we needed to go and then continued to give us tips on what to see where. Matt wrote down his website address on a bit of paper for one of them and the other took a photo of it with her phone so they could both have it. They told us when it was our stop and waved and smiled through the window as the train pulled away. So sweet.\nOur hostel K’s House Tokyo Oasis is a bit of a trek from the station with our bags but is also very lovely. Our exchange notes for our Japan Rail Pass had also arrived from Paris (via Delhi \u0026amp; Shanghai!) which is excellent news.\nMatt was extremely excited to see our ensuite electronic loo with sensor lighting, heated seat, two water sprays and music to play whilst you flush. The cistern is very economical – it is filled by a small tap running into a small sink so that you can wash your hands at the same time. Genius.\nOur next mission was to find food (surprise surprise).\nWe explored the local area of Asakusa and discovered we were just around the corner from one of Tokyo’s most popular tourist attractions – Senso-ji temple.\nBeing marvin, we were blinkered to it and had our first taste of Japan – gooey caramelised rice balls on sticks. They reminded me of the dates on sticks you get at Christmas. Our side-street ramen stop was more appetising.\nVentured into the underground system and our first stop was Ginza. Once again we were helped by a lovely lady on the tube who gave us directions.\nWhy Ginza? For the Sony Building of course. 6 floors of Sony stuff AND an aquarium AND 3D glasses 😀Then just around the corner was the Leica gallery. Matt was in heaven (although a little disappointed there were no walking robots to be seen).\nNext stop Akihabara, Electric City. 6 storeys again, this time of arcade games that made no sense to us because a) everything was written in Kanji and b) they were mental. Like trying to flip a table and corpse at a funeral???! But hey they were fun anyway.\nFinal stop of the day, Shibuya, for sushi in a teeny alleyway restaurant where the staff didn’t speak English. Yet again proving how lovely Japanese people are, the waitress asked another customer to come help us and the girl popped over, sat at our table and made some recommendations on what to order. She suggested an egg dish which turned out to be a cup of scrambled eggs with fish eaten with a tiny wooden spoon. Something we would never have known how to order or even thought or ordering, It was delicious.\nThoughts after our first day in Japan.

We looked at each other and thought where the hell are we going? Suddenly there was light at the end of the tunnel and we popped out at the Harbour Bridge itself. We sat there, the typical tourists, cameras pointing out of both sides of the train to try to get shots of the Opera House at speed.\nAnd turns out Milson’s Point couldn’t be closer to the bridge if it tried. And Luna Park. Although it happened to be closed on weekdays, we wandered by for a nose at the famous gates and funwheel. We really can’t get over how similar Australia is to the UK in so many ways. Although it’s the slightly newer more improved version with added sunshine. The things they tried \u0026amp; tested in the UK were brought over here. (Sorry if I offend anyone, Aussie or British). Like Luna Park being down under’s answer to Blackpool Pleasure Beach but quirkier and cooler.\nUnfortunately Luna Park is closed weekdays in the winter so we couldn’t go and play.\nBut on bright side it is built in one of the best locations in Sydney. Look at the views this giant face gets every day of its existence.\nYou’re probably wondering how many more angles we can get of the opera house \u0026amp; harbour bridge. Don’t worry, at least two I think.\nAfter a quiet streetside flat white and almost being attacked by one of the skankiest pigeons I’ve ever seen which looked like it had been buried in a tomb and been brought back to life by vampires, we wandered up through Kirribilli which was much more chilled than The Rocks and across the Harbour Bridge.\nView from the bridge pavement.Reaching the other side we spotted the pillion tower which you can walk up. We’d completely forgotten we’d wanted to do that so we did it. For the $11 entrance fee (which we are sure the guy pocketed as we heard no til open – but don’t want to accuse anyone of anything illegal here), we expected a long tough walk up hundreds of staircases. Instead we were only just getting warmed up when we were out of the viewing balcony. We could see the bridge climbers making their way over the archway strapped to a rail and suddenly $11 for a 5 min walk including lots of information about the bridge on the way up didn’t seem so bad. It was freezing and windy on the balcony here. God knows what it was like for those guys and they’d paid $179 for the luxury of 3hours in those conditions. Especially as it started raining as we came back down. So not having done the bridge climb and having no experience of it for comparison I would definitely recommend the tower over the climb.\nOur next recommendation is for lunch at the Met Centre on George Street. It’s the most upmarket food court we’ve ever been in and after 2pm when the lunch rush is over all of the counters have afternoon specials with up to a third off. We had a pile of sushi and a lemongrass beef baguette for $12.\nOur day in Sydney ended with a wander up George Street passing Victorian buildings and through the central shopping area full of modern malls. In the middle of them all was a magnificent building called The Strand. Why they let JB-Hifi open up in the basement is anyone’s guess but the rest of the shops do it justice. It is beautiful.\nJumped on the bus at Hyde Park, grabbed our luggage from Coogee and after two more bus journeys were at Sydney Airport. Finally got around to having a Hungry Jacks (Burger King) which is just want you want before getting on a plane and being fed an evening meal. It had to be done.\nThe Indonesian volcano didn’t affect our flight to Japan and off we went on our A330 for a 9 hour 15min flight to Narita at the scheduled time of 21:55.\nSweets for the flight:","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/10/12/day-309-tuesday-19th-july-sydney-the-end-of-australia-leg/","summary":"Hopped on the 9:20 train back to Sydney and at Central Station were planning on walking to the Harbour Bridge but made a rash decision to get another train leaving in 3 mins to Milson’s Point, the train station the other side of the Harbour bridge, or so we hoped.\nThe train travelled underground to Town Hall, then to Wyndham and when the voice over the tannoy said “next stop Milson’s Point” and we started slowing down we were still in darkness.","title":"Day 309 Tuesday 19th July – Sydney \u0026 the end of Australia leg"},{"content":"We are on a roll. We caught the rush hour bus to town, managed to get the one that didn’t go near the station which led to us leaping from the bus at Hyde Park at 9am, legging it to Central Station, buying tickets in a flash (there was absolutely zero queue – what is that all about in the main station of a huge city?), skipping through the barriers and onto the top floor of the double-decker parked on platform 6 with 1 min to spare for the 9:09 to Katoomba.\nMy heart was racing. How we made it without being run over/falling over/stampeding the slow people on the station stairs because the escalator was shut I’ll never know. True Burns style.\nAll the trains appear to be double-deckers. Lovely steel things with lush green faux-leather seats and big windows for good viewing (better \u0026amp; darn sight cheaper than that bloody Fraser Explorer bus – did I mention I wasn’t impressed by that little expedition?)\nAnd did I also mention the seats are two-way? Yes as a customer \u0026amp; traveller on an Aussie train you have the CHOICE of which way to face and whether you want to sit in a 4 or a 2. Amazing.\nAfter a pleasant 2.5hr journey and locating our very sweet homely hostel “No. 14” in Katoomba we headed out on our afternoon adventure to see the Blue Mountains. 1km in and we found ourselves in the lovely Leura, an avenue of wooden buildings housing shops of all delights from interior furnishings to chocolate to Christmas decorations. We were marvin by then and stopped for lunch to refuel before the proper walking commenced.\nOur route took us down a steep narrow muddy track to the Leura Cascades and we followed the Prince Henry Cliff walkway along the edge of the cliff with some spectacular views across the blue mountains.\nCan you spot me?\nWe reached the Three Sisters just as it began to rain which caused a rainbow to sprout over the famous rocks. There are a few different viewpoints of the Three Sisters on rocks jutting out over the valley.\nAfter a quick scoot around the obligatory tourist shopping centre and hugging a giant koala (as you do)…\n…we made our way to the Skyway at Scenic World as the sky cleared enough for the last rays of sun to hit the Three Sisters and have our own personal trip back across the valley.\nIt was a long old hilly walk back to the hostel but after filling up on meat pie \u0026amp; lamingtons* from the bakery we managed the last part happily content and it was lovely to get back to the cosy lounge with gas fire \u0026amp; hot cuppa before retiring to our even cosier room in the eaves with floral bed covers and wicker furniture.\n * We first tried lamingintons/lemmingtons whatever they’re called, soft sponge covered in chocolate and desiccated coconut. Another addition commenced and will be trying the recipe as soon as poss when back home.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/10/12/day-308-monday-18th-july-blue-mountains/","summary":"We are on a roll. We caught the rush hour bus to town, managed to get the one that didn’t go near the station which led to us leaping from the bus at Hyde Park at 9am, legging it to Central Station, buying tickets in a flash (there was absolutely zero queue – what is that all about in the main station of a huge city?), skipping through the barriers and onto the top floor of the double-decker parked on platform 6 with 1 min to spare for the 9:09 to Katoomba.","title":"Day 308 Monday 18th July – Blue Mountains"},{"content":"We saw the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge today. So excited! It didn’t seem real that we were actually in Sydney until we saw them. And it still doesn’t seem real now.\nStood looking the the Opera House for ages. The base of it is pretty ugly which consists of beige concrete and it is difficult to see the famous iconic shape of it from the bottom. But it doesn’t matter as you can get up close to the Swedish (? or Swiss?) tiles and see interesting shapes from all different angles. And you get a perfect full-on view of the Harbour Bridge from the end. And see the harbour waters from 3 sides. This was our first angle of SOH.\nAnd another angle.\nI was surprised how little people there were around the Opera House. It was relatively easy to get a photo without some random in it.\nSome arty anglesAs you can imagine we took hundreds of photos from every angle of the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge and of both together. So I’ve only included our favourite favourites and follow this link for more photos of the same but slightly different …\nAnd of course the obligatory silly photos of Karen by Matt.\nOur second angle of SOH was from the water. We caught the ferry to Manly which meant a 180 degree water tour of the famous building. There you could glimpse the more familiar angles. Especially from our front of boat spot. Perfect positioning. Especially special when a pod of dolphins swam next to the boat which Matt spotted first.\nThis guy waved us off (he was making a fortune).\nWe arrived at Manly 30mins later (hadn’t realised that Sydney city was in such a cove) not really knowing what was there. We’d heard it was a good beach for surfing but we weren’t really up for that. It was bloomin’ freezing. So we went for the fish’n’chips on the beach option and just watched the surfers from afar whilst surrounded by carnivourous seagulls. I became a victim as I foolishly dropped my guard for a second and a seagull swooped in and nabbed some fish batter straight from my fingers. It was almost in my mouth and I felt its claws grab my hand. Cheeky bugger.\nA wander around Manly found it to be a lovely seaside resort with sweet cafes and market stalls and an awful commercial main street of takeaways like Hungry Jacks and Subways. Everywhere is becoming the same. Still we manage to find a delightful cafe to try out the local caffeine and settle in for a while.\n3 hours later we were back on the ferry and wandering around The Rocks taking more photos of SOH and SHB looking for that perfect shot which Matt found.\nWe also tried to find the way up to the bridge for sunset and failed so ended up with silly photos overlooking another part of the harbour instead.\nStumbled across the dying embers of the Rocks weekend market and had a quick nose around. I think Matt was relieved as most stalls had packed up for the night so I couldn’t buy anything. Looked like a pretty good market though. Will have to come back.\nDidn’t take long before we were attracted to the Irish bar with its nice cold pints of Carlton Draught \u0026amp; live traditional Irish music. Then hunger set in and we happened across the Glenmore Hotel completely unintentionally.\nIt turns out they have a nice rooftop bar restaurant with rather spiffing views over the harbour (including from the urinals \u0026amp; one of the girls loos where the window was slightly ajar and sat down was perfect aligned). Couldn’t have planned it better.\nAnd the moon decided to put in an appearance too.\nWhat a spendiferous day.\nExtra bit – This photo believe it or not was taken just around the corner from the Harbour Bridge in The Rocks area. It’s a little bit of Yorkshire in the centre of Sydney.","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/10/12/day-307-sunday-17th-july-sydney-opera-house-harbour-bridge-all-that-jazz-manly/","summary":"We saw the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge today.

We had checked in online to “save time”. We stood in the “Bag Drop Off” line for 25mins whilst people arriving late for the Brisbane flight were called forward followed by whoever felt like it from any of the lines. I wasn’t the only one mumbling under my breath I can tell you.\nI guess it meant no faffing about with time to waste until boarding as we were straight on the plane and off to Sydney.\nUnfortunately the weather was still pretty annoying this morning so we saw none of the Great Barrier Reef from the air.\nWe’d bought a “Flexi-fare”, not out of choice, but out of necessity due to us leaving it until the last minute to book it. This meant we had a complimentary breakfast. For the price of the ticket for a 2hour domestic flight we were expecting a gourmet feast. Imagine our faces when we were presented with a flimsy plastic tray holding a bottle of OJ and a granola bar. Then passed a muffin \u0026amp; a bag of apple slices by the stewardess. What a feast! Still it filled a gap. And I suppose we are in health-conscious Oz rather than fry-up guzzling UK.\nArrived in Sydney and had to get to Coogee (soft “g”) by bus. This meant 2 different buses. The first the no. 400 which we had to get off at Randwick junction. We were like lemmings. Constantly bobbing our heads up and down looking for the right stop. The bus driver chucked us off in Randwick at what definitely didn’t have a “junction” feel but more like a Bedmo High Street. Still it had a Subway and we were famished. It gave us time to work out where we needed to go first.\nIn fact it was pretty simple. There were buses to Coogee going past every 5 mins. Shame we managed to get one going in a slightly different direction. It dropped us off at the street we wanted but according to the nice helpful British girls we met in the bus stop and the Aussie lady next to them who knew better we had a nice steep hill to climb. Of course we did.\nAnyway to cut a very long dull pointless story not very short we found Carrie’s flat at last!\nTo get over the jetlag we walked the 6km coastline from Coogee Beach to Bondi Beach. Immediately we could see why so many Brits come here and stay here. It’s like the English coast but with better amenities and consistently sunnier.\nEven on a winter’s day.\nCemetery on the cliff.\nBeautiful, poignant sculpture, a memorial for those who died in the Bali bombings in October 2002.\nAnd they have loads of kooky old-fashioned swimming pools next to the sea where sometimes the waves come crashing over the walls smothering the swimmers. It was like travelling back in time watching the skull-capped swimmers moving up \u0026amp; down up \u0026amp; down.\nAnd little coves where men dive into the freezing waters to get some exercise. Or try some diving.\nAfter dilly-dallying along the way looking at interesting views, we finally reached the infamous Bondi Beach to find an upmarket version of Weston-super-mare with nothing less than an ice-rink on the darn beach. We’ve seen some surreal things throughout this trip and when we think we can’t possibly see anything weirder something crops up to surprise us again.\nIt was Bondi Beach’s Winter Wonderland. Ice-skating, sheds selling bratwursts and dutch pancakes and a beer tent with gas lamps serving German beer, gluhwein \u0026amp; pretzels with a guy playing the squeezebox singing Oktoberfest songs with a slight look on madness in his eyes. Not to mention the free Chai Latte tent with fake roaring fires and fake Christmas trees. All whilst surfers caught the waves that crashed on the beach behind.\nLoved it.\nIce hockey on Bondi anyone?We followed this excitement with a warming pint in the seafront Bavarian Bier bar and then had to work out how to get back to Coogee without having to traipse 6km back. It was a challenge as for some reason there are no buses between the beaches. Instead we got one bus to Bondi Junction then another to Coogee. We just about had the brain capacity left to deal with this.\nCarrie took us out for a delicious Thai meal in Coogee that evening. It was our first proper meal out in a while as we’ve mostly been cooking in hostels in Australia. We also experienced our first liquor store walk-in freezer. Small things eh?\nIt’s nice to be staying in a proper home with a proper bed again and less than 20 people to share the bathroom with. Plus it’s good to see Sydney from the point of view of someone living here rather than just as a tourist. We’re getting to see things we wouldn’t have seen if we’d stayed in Kings Cross.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/10/12/day-306-saturday-16th-july-sydney-coogee-beach-to-bondi-beach/","summary":"Another nice early start and we were at Cairns domestic airport at 5:30 queuing Easyjet-stylie at the Virgin Blue check-in desks.

It’s becoming a common occurrence with us, early mornings. Are we old? (We definitely have the crows feet \u0026amp; grey hair these days. It’s hard work all this travelling malarkey.)\nBut this was for a much better reason than some bus driver waking us up to get a move on. We were off diving!\nWe had to be at the marina by 7 and by some miracle were up and dressed with cheesy vegemite coated toast in hand we were out the side gate, a swift gallivant through town and down to the boat RedKist on pier E (or finger as they call it here??) just in time.\nThough it didn’t matter. We didn’t leave the marina until 8am. But then we were there early enough for coffee, cake \u0026amp; fresh pineapple. And we tried Lamington for the first time. You see trays of the stuff in bakeries \u0026amp; supermarkets but we’d never found the budget to buy any. They were yummy. Must get more of those!\nThe journey to the reef was of mixed emotions. Matt became part of the seasickness clan, standing on the back of the boat with at least fifteen others with rolling stomachs. Lucky for him he wasn’t actually puking unlike most of the crowd huddled over their brown paper bags. I popped out there for moral support and ended up having the middle finger on my right hand crushed by the sliding door when we hit a particularly big wave. It took my mind off the swaying boat I’ll tell you. (And is still painful 12 hours later – sympathy please).\nApparently the latch on the door broke the last time they were out on rough waters and one of the crew members had crushed the same finger just yesterday. Hmmm…\nAnyway neither seasickness or squashed fingers could prevent us from diving and off we went at 11:25 into the slightly chilly choppy but clear waters of the GBR.\nYou can see a lot of the coral from the boat. It reaches just above the surface in many areas and the deepest part of the ocean was no more than 12metres. They were shallow dives which was good with our nervousness after so long since our Andaman dives. Still once I’d unravelled myself from the guide-rope and we’d kicked back against the current to the back of the boat and followed the anchor line down the nerves passed.\nAlthough we didn’t see a great deal of sealife, no turtles or sharks as expected, it was a great experience swimming through corridors in the reef. Our diving guide passed a sea cucumber to me which promptly spewed its white intestines all over my hands as a defence mechanism. Matt caught the sea cucumber after I kind of pushed it in his direction and luckily only had some leftovers stick to him.\nI tried for most of the 30min dive to get it off rubbing it on coral the guide showed me and longer on the boat scrubbing with paper towels and soap. It was like a fine white net of glue and chewing gum. No-one would go near me until it was gone. It can sting your eyes apparently.\nHad a really good day on the boat. We were even fed a hearty lunch and chocolate cake mid-afternoon. Perfect. (Had to get a reference to food in somewhere).\nAnd on the way back no-one had problems with seasickness. Good cake is obviously the best preventative.\nGreat Barrier Reef was a little disappointing for sealife. We saw fish but most we had seen before in the Andamans like Parrotfish, Clown Anemone fish \u0026amp; Angelfish. Maybe we were spoilt with the Andaman sea because it is unspoilt.

In Thailand you expect to veer off the road into a tree at any time but at least the seats are suited to overnight travel. The Greyhound buses in Oz are the worst for sleeping on. Their seats are just a little too small to curl up on so you can never get comfy. The aircon was on so it was cold too. And to top it off the onboard loo wasn’t functioning. So 15 mins later we had to make an adhoc loo stop.\nAfter less than 5 and a half hours we were being manoeuvred off the bus into the Reef Terminal in Cairns.

That will do.\nThere we were at 7am eating bacon \u0026amp; egg McMuffins \u0026amp; drinking flat whites and lattes. Their coffee has definitely improved. Or were we just knackered?\nAnyway after a nightmare journey the lovely Jenny from Dreamtime backpackers turns up and gives us a lift to the hostel. It really is only a 15min walk (maybe 20 with backpacks) but we’re glad of the ride and of the brekkie.\nToo early for our room we end up sat in Cairns Central mall just across the road for a while, admiring the Wendy’s shake \u0026amp; dog deal.\nOur attention is then drawn to the lagoon in town and we head there for some relaxation until the room is ready. What a gorgeous free facility. UK Government take note. We want open plan infinity pool lagoons in our towns. With free bar-b-qs. And showers. And fake beach.\nOur room is ready and it’s the cutest little shed you’ve ever seen in the garden next to the swimming pool. I’m sure fairies built it.\nThe sun is glowing now so what do you do? Sunbathe by the lagoon, swim in the lagoon (for a few mins cos it is cold in there!), cook Aussie burgers on the free hot plate using the cheapest tongs we could purchase from Woolworths supermarket and just generally chill.\nNormally we prefer smaller towns but we actually quite like Cairns.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/07/23/day-301-monday-11th-july-cairns/","summary":"…I was wrong.

Matt wanted to get a photo of me doing this (and I wasn’t adverse to holding a koala either) so we joined in the tour. We both expected it to be cheesy and for kids. It was both but also now another favourite thing we’ve done on our trip. You get a real hands-on experience of Australian animals and it was interesting listening to the Steve Irwin character passionately talking about endangered crocodiles. We fed a large bird a pumpkin seed from our mouths which it peeled with its beak before eating, saw an echidna (small porcupine animal) eat dinner with a lizard, held lizards, a crocodile, a snake \u0026amp; a koala. And saw a joey on its mother’s back. It was the best $21 we’d spent in Oz. Fraser Island eat your heart out.\nCute koala videos:\nYou have to turn your head on its side for this one (sorry my inept camera work strikes again):\n  Even after the tour, we continued spotting wildlife.\nA number of these chaps were chilling out under some bushes near the kitchen.\nAnd we saw a pair of porcupine thingymajigs out in the wild on an afternoon walk.\nAh yes our afternoon walk. It was meant to be an afternoon of snorkelling. We borrowed the gear, walked for 30mins to Arthur’s Bay, put all the gear on, stepped into the water to knee high and turned around and came back out. The water was cold and gravelly and the waves were strong. Neither of us are strong swimmers and after the incident in Sihanoukville where Matt almost drowned we thought better of it. A nice stroll around the bays made more sense.\nWe had no map (I had a vague recollection of the route being 6km), no phone, flip flops on our feet and snorkel, mask \u0026amp; huge fins to carry with us. The sun was dropping behind the hills. Of course it made sense.\nTo start with it was a normal tarmac road. A little sloping perhaps but no problem. We made a brief stop at Florence Bay, completely deserted and prettier than Arthur’s Bay. Skipped down to Radical Bay and back then followed the route along a narrow pathway with long grass either side which turned into a track through woodland and then a hilly rocky climb up and down the other side to Horseshoe Bay. The rocks were where we saw the echidnas. Well almost as the tide had come in so we had to clamber around the back of the mangroves following the water pipes into the bush to come out in a random side road which then went to Horseshoe Bay. Phew we made it. And the sun was just disappearing over the horizon.\nIt took a while, and no, flip-flops aren’t the best hiking gear but it was a beautiful walk, despite the rocky terrain.\nThe rocky landscape of rounded boulders reminded us of Hampi and the Flintstones.\nWe treated ourselves to Billabongs. I have to mention this because we are addicted to these simple chocolate ice-cream lollies. They are delicious at any time of the day. Even twice a day.\nBack at Bungalow Bay we had to side-step a couple of possums on the way to the kitchen.\nI think our Australian wildlife spotting is complete.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/07/23/day-299-saturday-9th-july-magnetic-island-more-aussie-wildlife/","summary":"Woke early to the sun shining through the perspex windows and birds chirping \u0026amp; chuckling. There is a wildlife sanctuary in the grounds of our accommodation which offer the opportunity to cuddle a koala.

Matt had to ask the driver what had happened. Apparently the brake lights on the trailer it was pulling had failed in the middle of the night.

We had a didgeridoo lesson. There were about 14 of us in a shop, didges on the counter, learning to play. Matt was a natural of course and even shocked the teacher with his circular breathing which normally takes a few days to learn. I didn’t have a bloody clue. Most of my playing sounded like farting. Matt’s sounded more tuneful and that caused a problem. We had to buy one now didn’t we.\nSpent 90mins pondering and testing them out and pondering some more and thinking it’s too much money but we really like them and it would be cool to have it and learn to play but we just saved money on Whitsundays and now we’re blowing it on a piece of wood but it is a beautiful piece of wood and it would be lush to have one and we can get our own aboriginal symbols put on it etc, etc, etc.\nSo we have the above didgeridoo on order which will be winging its way to the UK in August.

Unfortunately they were all out of service due to being completely knackered so we jumped on the shuttle bus into Agnes to think of what to do next. And what did Matt spot at the bus stop? Electric bikes. We went for the 1-hour hire to do a 14km round trip. Could we make it?\nOf course we could, we were on bicycles with magic powers. We glided up the steep hills without any puffing \u0026amp; panting and reached the tip of 1770 effortlessly.\nWith the clock ticking though we only had a quick stop for a couple of photos and for Matt to almost run over a kangaroo.

A top destination for anyone visiting the East Coast of Australia, apparently.\nWe’d been “sold” the bus trip by the guy at our hostel. We were going to do the 2-day 1-night camping but that was sold out so we were going to do the 1-day jeep but somehow he managed to persuade us the bus would be better. I think this is proof that we are out of our minds. How many times in NZ did we see hoards of people on bus trips being moved from place to place on a strict schedule and think or say how awful it looked and how we’d hate that kind of thing? Well we were right.\nOK the weather didn’t help. Once again the sunny period that was promised for at least the next 3 days didn’t materialise. The blue skies of yesterday had been replaced by thick grey clouds. And at 7:15am it was bloomin freezing waiting to be picked up.\nAt 7:25 along comes our bus. It appears to be the same as the one in the photo so all is good. Big low windows, not too many seats. 40mins later after an exciting tour of the suburbs of Hervey Bay picking up from what seemed like every hotel \u0026amp; campsite we arrive at the ferry port.\nOff we trot to get our tickets and then onto the ferry. It was quite a pleasant trip even though we were freezing our backsides off. Can I just point out that normally I’m pretty cautious about wearing layers just in case but we were expecting 100% sunshine so shorts \u0026amp; t-shirts \u0026amp; flip-flops didn’t really cut it on this open-air ferry.\nArriving at Fraser Island we were manoeuvred into the One Day Fraser Island Tour queue. Suddenly we were standing with what seemed like 100 other people all waiting to get on a very normal coach looking vehicle. It was a game of sardines. The windows were higher so you could barely see the ground and there was barely knee-space for me let alone anyone taller. I was livid. Matt was his usual optimistic self and said it will be fine.\nOK so it wasn’t just a normal coach as it was 4WD and the roads across the island are all sand so you get a feeling of being on a rollercoaster. But it was still a busload of people to get from one place to the next.\nAnd first stop was Central Station. A walk along a boardwalk through the rainforest to hear about the trees \u0026amp; creek for 30 mins with 50 other people. Sound like fun? I spent most of the time trying to take a photo of this kookaburra. It was the first one we’d seen and wildlife interests me more than trees.\nEverything in the rainforest is gigantic – a plant from the orchid family clinging onto a tree. It doesn’t feed off the tree.We all piled back in the coach. Not a mean feat with so many to organise.\nNext stop was Eurong Bay for 5 mins. And then we were on our way. The highlight – driving along 75-mile beach. Well it was pretty cool for about 10 mins. Seeing the bush on one side and the waves on the other. It’s a shame we couldn’t see more of the sand but the windows were too high.\nSpeed limits on the beach.And after 30mins it was a tad samey. Good job we encountered the shipwreck. That was actually a highlight of ours, be it we could only stop for 5 mins.\nNext were the Coloured Sands \u0026amp; The Pinnacles. Probably another 20min drive. Here’s a photo.\nThat was worth the extra drive, eh?\nWe would go no further but backtrack to Eli Creek. A most fascinating place. A freshwater creek running into the sea. Well I’d never seen one of those before. Matt \u0026amp; I made ourselves have a paddle for the sheer hell of it and have to say it was pleasantly warm. Can see if the weather is right you could swim in it. But in the middle of winter that’s not going to happen.\nMatt’s optimism had faded by now. He wandered off to have a look at the sea and a stick.\nYou could pay $70 for a 10-min trip in a plane to the next place. We didn’t but it was cool seeing them take off along the sand. After all that excitement it was back to Eurong Bay for our buffet lunch. We stuffed our faces and made some takeaway ham \u0026amp; cheese rolls for the afternoon journey. Just to get our money’s worth 😀\nSomehow the guide managed to get everyone on the bus promptly and we headed to Lake Mackenzie where we had 1hour 20mins to spend sunbathing and swimming in the lake. Not to miss an opportunity, even though it was still grey and had been raining whilst on the bus, we both braved the icy lake which was the clearest water we’d ever seen. It was a beautiful place and if it had been a boiling hot summer’s day you can see the attraction.\nSpotted some more wildlife above the toilets whilst changing. The place was surrounded. Don’t they say that most spiders in Australia are poisonous?\nThat was the end of the trip. We arrived at the port to see the tide was lower than normal and wondered how the ferry would ever get to shore. We would be stranded with the spiders and the bus load of tourists. Arghh!\nLuckily the captain of the ferry was extremely talented and did some magnificent 3-point turning to get the ferry along the narrow creek and into position. We all piled on and waited with baited breath to see if we could move or be mud-bound.\nWith the help of the vehicles on board which were moved to the end of the ferry we were able to edge along the creek and out into the ocean. We were free!\nAnd there ends one of the most expensive days this entire trip. And one of the most disappointing. There were some good bits don’t get me wrong. The shipwreck was cool and the lake was pretty. But the highlight was the return ferry journey. We even saw a couple of dolphins disappear into the shadows as the sun set.\nWe know now that we should have stuck to our guns and did the jeep trip.

And there he was sat calm as anything back to the world clinging onto the high branches on a eucalyptus tree next to the busy roundabout by our hostel. He occasionally turned his head very slowly around and looked down at the interested crowd beneath with click clicking cameras seeming nonplussed by all the attention he was getting. It appears that seeing one this close-up and in full-view is rare. We overheard a passerby say to her young daughter “look at that, normally we only get to see their bum, don’t we?”.\nSo our mission to see wild koalas had been fulfilled before even leaving for the national park.\nStill we went on our wander around the park. We took the coastal path which passes a number of surfing coves.\nThen headed inland up through the Tangled Forest on the lookout for more wildlife. Needless to say we didn’t spot a single koala bear. Not even a cheek. Nor any kookaburras although we may have heard one. Matt tried whistling and a few whistles came back from the leaves above. There was evidence of koalas though as many of the trees had been completely stripped of their bark which lay heaped at the base of the tree and spirals were marked on the trunk, possibly from their claws.\nStill we’d seen a real-life wild koala earlier so we were content.\nBy this time the sun had decided to come out of its shell completely and it had turned into a scorcher of a day. We soaked up the sun as best we could in our long trousers \u0026amp; trainers and sat on rocks watching the surfers \u0026amp; boogie-boarders enjoying the waves at Little Cove wishing we had more time in Noosa so that we could join them. Especially when leaving the beach we saw the temperature was a delightful 27°.\nWell time to move on to the next place and Hervey Bay here we come.\nToday is a day for Australian animal spotting as we also saw a kangaroo today. And not just any kangaroo. No. It was Matilda, the 1982 Commonwealth Games mascot. There was an “interesting” story behind her current location. This was Matilda Roadhouse, a service station just north of Noosa. They started business in 1982 and had called themselves Matilda after the famous mascot. It took them 27 years exactly to buy her and another 16 months to restore her. I’m assuming to add the large medallion. I don’t know whether she already turned her head, wiggled her ears and winked an eye before her restoration but whoever thought of that is macabre. It is way too freaky.\nArrived at Hervey Bay “transit centre” surrounded by the usual McDonalds, KFC, Hungry Jacks (a rip-off of Burger King or the same company?), etc 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Possibly related to the Asian-style mode of driving our Greyhound driver adopted to get us from Noosa. You had to feel sorry for him though. The guy was obviously feeling poorly as he could hardly speak more than a squeak and it being school holidays it was Dad’s take your kids to work day so had two young kids sat on the front seats to keep in line with fizzy orange pop.\nOur Friendly Hostel is like a mini house. 3 bedrooms per “unit” so there’s a maximum of 7 people to share the facilities with. A decent sized lounge and kitchen, a proper oven \u0026amp; a flat-screen TV. The only thing letting it down is it only has ONE toilet and ONE shower and they’re BOTH in the SAME room.

Yahoo!\nAs everyone else moved off into their designated pickup mini-buses, we being the usual turn up and see, decided on the YHA for its closest proximity to the bus stop (we now seem to be carting around a total of 6 bags – 2 backpacks, 2 rucksacks, 1 bag of souvenirs and a coolbag) and turns out the lovely Noosa Heads beach.\nHalse Lodge YHA is a gorgeous old-looking wooden structured building with a veranda around the first floor covered in cushion-strewn sofas \u0026amp; armchairs. They have a large communal area with pool table, footy table (Matt is happy) and ping-pong table plus a licensed bar and an outdoor area covered in wooden tables \u0026amp; chairs.\nOur room is a sweet sizeable place with natural wooden floors, wooden bed-side tables and old criss-cross wooden windows with the quirky addition of bars with catflaps to enable you to reach the latches. Not that it matters as they are warped so don’t shut properly. No matter, we like the place instantly.\nA walk along the beach and main street finds that Noosa is a holiday destination for backpackers and rich people. We find a shop with a sale of 70% off and the clothes are still too expensive for us. Our lunch is a shared Subway $7 footlong. The cheapest food we could find.\nLater that day whilst Matt climbed his way up through the rankings of Wednesday night’s “foosball” competition I chatted to a group of girls from Rugby. They were all just about to head off to uni and I enquired with one which course she was doing. “Criminology” was the reply. “Sounds interesting”, I replied, “I love all the psychological stuff. Did you ever see Cracker?” A blank face looked back at me. “You know that one with Robbie Coltrane in it.” Still a blank face. “The guy who is Hagrid in Harry Potter?” Suddenly there were signs of recognition and a reply “Oh yes I know who Hagrid is”.\nThere endeth the conversation as the realisation hit that my hair is old and my face is young but my hair (and knowledge of 90s TV) tells the truth!\nForgetting all that, back to Matt. After a grilling combat and good defence, plus an over-egotistical American shouting “Who loves me?” over and over, Matt came 3rd. Then defaulted to 2nd as the aforementioned American defaulted by being a member of staff. That meant a good win of $10 to spend at the bar. A free bowl of nachos became our dinner. And lovely they were too. Food always tastes better when it’s free. The beers on the other hand weren’t free but tasted just as good anyway.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/07/19/day-289-wednesday-29th-june-noosa/","summary":"Arrived in Noosa after a pleasant Greyhound trip to find the sun ablazing.

I forgot to mention we do actually have a fridge, kettle (an actual electric jug*!) \u0026amp; toaster in the room – bonus. Anyway the brekkie basket consisted of 2 bowls, 2 plates, a mini-pack of weet-bix for moi, a mini-pack of cornflakes for matt, 2 half pint cartons of milk (like what you get in playschool milk), two tetrapaks of OJ and portions of butter, jam \u0026amp; vegemite. Ah the famous Aussie equivalent of Marmite to try. Plus a teatowel (are we meant to wash it up afterwards?) We had to ask for bread. So imagine us attempting to sit comfortably on a double bed trying not to fall down the gap between it and the wall because it keeps shooting across the room on its castor wheels, balancing a bowl of cereal \u0026amp; plate of toast on our laps watching the Aussie equivalent to GMTV and realising morning TV has the same inept unfunny presenters all over the globe.\nThe sun is out.

Off we stomp to the harbourside where half of Brisbane seem to be out to laze on the grass and get some rays and eat a daytime kebab (yes we were sober and yes it tasted good).\nAnd have an obligatory ice-cream on the “beach”.Hopped onto the City Cat ferry along the river under the Brisbane Story bridge which kind of wants to be Sydney Harbour bridge as it now also has a climb for an extortionate amount of money.\nDisembarked further down the winding river at New Far with the idea of walking up through the area that I can’t remember the name of but has lots of live music and then onto Chinatown. Well we did just about do all that. But only after spending 3hours in Coffee Club trying to sort out where to go next, purchasing our East Coast hop-on hop-off Greyhound bus tickets and getting high on caffeine.\nFound some good \u0026amp; bad live music at The Tempo Club where they were in the middle of their Battle of the Bands competition, tasted our first Aussie beer – Carlton Draught – and with no time to spare marched past Chinatown with a quick squizz at the main street before stomping back to Acacia for our last night in Brisbane.\n*I’m currently reading Down Under by Bill Bryson – read it!\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/07/19/day-288-tuesday-28th-june-brisbane/","summary":"Last night we got back to Acacia to find a breakfast basket on our bed.

You would have thought by now with a helicopter ride up glaciers, bungy jumping over a canyon and a light aircraft flight 15000m up to fall out into the sky, a 4 hour flight would be a doddle. Nope. i didn’t like the fact we were one of the first flights to go with Qantas since the ash cloud cleared. And we had a couple of moments of turbulence. that wouldn’t have been so bad hadn’t the co-pilot say in a hurried voice “please can all passengers return to their seats immediately and put their seatbelts on” followed by two air stewardesses rushing through to the front of the plane. It’s not something I’m comfortable with.\n8:00 (Oz time) So anyway we landed after a bit more turbulence through thick cloud and now we’re in Brisbane!\nI was once again paranoid about the customs procedure. They say you have to declare all food items and I’d made Matt bring all the condiments from the van including chill sauce. So we declared them and they were fine about it. Although the drug-squad dog seemed interested in the chill sauce. It meant we ditched the last of our Cambodian honey but it was looking a bit worse for wear after 4 months of being lugged around.\n From first glance of Brisbane we like it. It’s very built up but very laid back.\nTo take stock and work out a plan of action we needed caffeine and what better way to do it than a mug of cappuccino with a side of free cinnamon doughnuts. We were buzzing and made our way to a central motel called Acacia which had the feeling of being an old hospital crossed with an old people’s home. It must have been built in the 70s and never been touched since. Still it was a bed for the night.\nNot wanting to stay in Acacia too long we headed out into Brisbane city centre and quickly found interesting architecture, both british colonial and aussie modern.\nThe harbourside was particularly interesting. On the one side of the river the CBD.\nOn the other side it stretched from the Brisbane Art gallery, the Gallery of Modern Art and the City Library at one end to the free swimming pool with free superficial beach \u0026amp; palm trees (they were real) surrounded by lawned areas with free bar-b-qs at the other and a giant ferris wheel inbetween.\nWe ventured into both galleries and the library. The latter of course to use the free wifi and join the hundreds of others scattered around a huge room plugged into their laptops. It felt like the future.\nLovely city. The only letdown, is it’s actually pretty cold and a little rainy. Where is the warm sunshine we were promised Gold Coast?!\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/07/19/day-287-monday-27th-june-australia-brisbane/","summary":"We made it.\n2:30 alarm.\n3:15 left apartment.\n3:35 on bus to airport.\n4:10 check in.\n4:40 security check – Matt gets searched twice – he’s got the hoody and the beanie but of course it is random.\n6:00 (NZ time) on the easyjet style plane for an uneasy flight.

An amazing piece of engineering, apparently. Pulled up in the car park at 9:40 and made a nice cup of tea before wandering over 10 mins later to wait for the dam to open.\nIt finally dawned on us 15 mins later that the dam was already open. The water was obviously already gushing through and there was no magnificent ceremony to behold. They’d opened them bloody early.\nLuckily there were only about 10 of us who looked foolish standing on a bridge staring at some gushing water through a concrete wall. What a let down. It was no Huka Falls.\nBy 10:30 we were back on the road (bye bye Taupo we will miss you, except maybe the dam) and onwards and upwards to Rotorua, a town seeped in both Maori history and hot water.\nUnfortunately the main geyser which rises 10m out of the ground is closely guarded by an extortionate entrance fee \u0026amp; a scary old lady at Te Puia. It being freezing cold we couldn’t be bothered to spend enough time wandering around the area to chance on the spouting geyser to justify the expense.\nInstead we went for the free option – Kuiria Park just off the town centre. And it wasn’t a let down. You drive into the carpark and can see clouds of steam in sporadic spots all over the park. Sporadic clouds rose from the park grounds. Steamy pools and bubbling mud holes. Just imagine the Bog of Eternal Stench and you’ll be close. This is why the town stinks of rotten eggs.\nEven a free foot spa which was surprisingly hot.As fascinating as it was to see hot bubbling water rising through the ground creating cracks in roads it made us realise how close we actually were to the goings on beneath the surface of the earth and how volatile it is. Why build a town in an area so close to underground molten lava where parts of the ground can just disappear at any moment.\nWe didn’t stick around in Rotorua. We’ve found our mood for sight-seeing is directly proportionate to the amount of sunlight we get and it was very cloudy today. So we continued on to a campsite on the coast at Maketu in the Bay of Plenty (kiwi country of the fruit kind) and holed up there for the night hoping tomorrow would be sunnier.\nWe chose it specifically to get a cheap campsite to power up the camper (the fridge has a habit of defrosting itself after 3 unpowered nights) and our trusty IAC internet access (you can disconnect the broadband from the geek but…).\nIt’s in the middle of nowhere so the IAC access is as flaky as anything.\nIt’s good to have a proper shower though.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/07/10/day-274-5503km-to-5422km-419-tuesday-14th-june-rotorua-maketu/","summary":"We have been away for 9 months now.\nAwoke to a chillier day and made for another local attraction – the 10am opening of the dam.

But walking to the plane my nerves started getting to me and in the plane I couldn’t relax. Especially when they brought out the oxygen as we got to 13,000ft. Hence the stressed-out look at the beginning of the video.\nMatt on the other hand seemed his usual chilled-out self the whole time but I think secretly he was peeing himself it being his first ever skydive. It’s not natural to throw yourself out of a plane.\nBut surprisingly (for me) as soon as I had to manoeuvre to the door of the plane and dangle in mid-air I was completely chilled and loved that feeling of falling out into the sky and start whizzing towards the earth.\n60 seconds of freefall from 15000 to 5000ft with a guy recording every second of it followed by 5 mins under the parachute where I got to steer us a couple of times left and right towards beautiful Lake Taupō.\nSomehow although I left the plane before Matt, he landed before me so was there to wave as I landed.\nWe then had to do some random stupid celebration for the DVD. That was the hardest bit. You’re still completely spaced out from dropping 15000ft and you’re being asked to act stupid in front of a video camera. I think we looked stupid enough doing not much at all.\nSo anyway here are a couple of pics and the silly videos of me \u0026amp; Matt.\nmy turn firstMatt’s turn\nFUN VIDEOS TO BE INCLUDED AT A LATER DATE 😀\nWhat do you do after something as fantabulous as skydiving?

What is going on? We are in the middle of nowhere again but all these people are turning up and getting out of their cars with their thermos’ to have a natter. It finally dawns on us they are most probably here for some memorial as almost all of them are wearing black. And there we are munching on toast with the radio blaring out Katy Perry \u0026amp; Lady Gaga.\nEven the swans wore black.\n2 hour drive took us from Napier to Taupō in the centre of the North Island and the largest lake in New Zealand – Lake Taupō. It’s 6000km² and is the size of Singapore. Apparently Singapore has a population of 4.8m. New Zealand has a population of 4.2m. No wonder we’ve hardly seen anyone here.\nWhen we arrived it was exceedingly sunny and the lake looked like shimmering glass.\nOur attempt to feed the ducks failed as they were being stuffed to the gills by the group of toddlers further upshore so we moved further along into Taupō and found they were motorhome friendly. Hooray! This meant we could park up on the lakefront and leave it there without worrying about where to sleep. It would be our home for the night.\nFirst stop was the Hole in One golf challenge. Matt couldn’t resist. The prize was $10,000. How could anyone resist? It looked pretty much impossible to me and without any golfing skills whatsover Matt easily whacked 25 golfballs into the lake in all directions. Annoyingly he was doing perfectly well on his own with incorrect swing and bent posture and was getting it nearer and nearer to the target but the guy running it couldn’t resist giving him a golfing lesson and after that it kind of went pear-shaped. It is possible to over-think things. Ah well it’s the taking part that counts. (Apparently 776 people have managed a hole-in-one – one every two weeks – so any keen golfers out there may want to risk the airfare to NZ to try it out as it’ll pay for the airfare back 😉).\nDecided to get some exercise as had been particularly lazy lately. Followed the Huka Falls walk from the centre of Taupō which according to the LP takes 1 to 1.5 hours and according to tourism brochures takes 2 hours. Both are pretty optimistic. They assume you are psychic and know the route as there aren’t any bloody signs until you reach Spa park (after 90mins) via random roads, a cemetery, Taupō bungy and a couple of car parks.\nStill it was worth the power-walking to reach it before the sun disappeared completely behind the trees.\nAnd it was nice not to have to move the van when we finally got back (after a pint at the local Irish bar). Just cosy up and warm our achy limbs.\nHumour at the Irish pub.

Tested out the LP walking tour as didn’t really know where to start. This included a ride on the old-fashioned cable car (or vernacular as we’d call it). It’s really a commuter car picking up and dropping off Wellingtonians and university students at various stops on the hill. It’s very quaint and the free Cable Car museum at the top is worth a 2-min whizz round. Matt insisted on the silly photo opportunity.\nSo I insisted on the standing in a huge cylindrical tree photo. Haha revenge!\nOn the advice of the cool old guy selling cable car tickets we only went one way and meandered back down through the Botanical gardens. A highlight was the kid’s playground (14 years \u0026amp; under)…\nAnd the Cacti and Succulent garden.\nMustn’t forget the outdoor lift camouflaged by vines and shrubbery which helps you miss out at least a 2-min stretch of pathway.\nThe rose garden was pretty even without many roses, it being winter and all that. I’m sure it would be beautiful in the spring and know that mum \u0026amp; nan would love it.\nThe final part of the garden walk takes you through an old cemetery which appears to have a whopping great motorway across the middle of it. Not sure there’s much RIP-ing going on there.\nIt’s lunchtime and we find Chow Main Cube in the business district dishing up superbly tasty freshly cooked Hokkien noodles served in one of those American-style boxes with a cute handle and chopsticks. Hooray we’re back in Asia! (Did we say we were missing it?)\nStuffed to the brim we end up back at the van for a quick cuppa (we are VERY old now – we blame the campervan) and spend an hour trying to work out a plan of action for the rest of our trip. Love New Zealand (esp Wellington) but we are cold and it keeps bloody raining. We want some sun! Do we try Oz and hope it’s sunny there or head somewhere like Fiji? Turns out we can go Auckland –\u0026gt; Fiji –\u0026gt; LA –\u0026gt; home for £100 extra. Hmmm is that really what we want though? We’re so darn close to Oz it would be silly not to go! So leave the decision for another day…\nWe ditch the walking tour and go straight to Te Papa the national museum. Although distracted by a guy creating bubbles on the bridge. He’s experimenting with different compositions apparently.\n   An impressive monster of a building right on the waterfront it is very well designed and has lots of cool interactive science-y stuff to keep Matt happy. There’s a lot of interesting info about how NZ was formed, the Ring of Fire and where all of the volcanoes are related to the earthquakes that have occurred. We didn’t realise that over the past century there has been some kind of earthquake, tsunami or volcano eruption pretty much every other year somewhere in NZ. Lake Taupo, on our list of places to visit in the North Island, is in fact an active volcano. What??!\nBack on the walking tour we wander through Civic Square with a cleverly suspended silver fern ball at its centre…\n…and onto Cuba Street with the weirdest fountain ever. A series of tipping buckets splash water from one to the next soaking everything within 10 metres of it. The pedestrianized area was drenched in water and everyone walking towards it looked suddenly very strange as they swerved to avoid the area.\nSpotting a bar called Bristol Hotel we felt obliged to pop in for a pint of the old Mac’s Gold. Although very busy, it unfortunately had that “Wetherspoons” feel of cheap decor and even cheaper nastier food. I shouldn’t really comment on the food as I didn’t eat any and the beer did taste OK. But it just had that vibe. Sounding very snobby now. Far to snobby for a traveller who needs to be saving her money.\nSpeaking of pinching the pennies, we ventured further into Wellington along Courteney Place and spotted a bar selling $5 pizzas until 7pm. It was 6:58 so we rushed in and ordered two immediately. Result cheap pizza. Felt compelled to order two beers too (well you have to don’t you). We’d fallen into the trendy bar trap. Cheap food, expensive beer. Bugger. Good job that darn pizza was tasty.\nWe resisted temptation to have any more beers and strolled along the waterfront back to our house on wheels. Wellington looks very cool at night reflected in the sea and the harbourside is one of those well-designed developed areas with arty landscaping and trendy warehouse bars. And reminiscent of home.\nThis is one place we could definitely stay in for a while.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/07/10/day-269-4598km-to-4612km-3614-thursday-9th-june-wellington/","summary":"Found a great place to park up the campervan smack in the centre of Wellington harbour-side.

They had one double room left. We asked how much and the guy said make me an offer. Strange we thought. But it was a windowless dingy looking room. Matt suggested forty dollars and the guy agreed. No haggling. That seemed a bargain to us as the closest holiday park wanted $46. Too good to be true me thinks.\nTwo hours later there’s a knock at the door. Another bloke who works there is saying there has been a mistake and we need to move to a dorm. There’s one across the hall that is empty and so he’d try to keep it that way if possible. OK we agree to move.\n20 mins later he’s back. We have to move to another dorm because that one was now fully-booked. Right. He says we can get a discount and a bottle of wine. So now we’re having to take a bed in a filled to the brim dorm. Neither of us was sure about this but were just about to go out before all the moving palava and neither of us wanted the hassle of moving somewhere else. It was only one night after all. Maybe the wine swayed our decision.\nSo we head out into Dunedin for a few beers and a bento box. Returning hours later slightly worse for wear. Very good bars in Dunedin by the way. Especially Albar, a Scottish pub with British ales, German weisse bier and Bulmers on tap.\nCrash out in the dorm.\nAt 5am two guys come back drunk and the one who happens to be sleeping in the bed above us starts shouting about someone having been through his stuff. Babbling on about he’d been round the world and never been anywhere like this. Etc etc. Starts having a go at another couple in the next bed. Turns the light on and carries on. We try to ignore him but he starts to grate and I am particularly grumpy when woken up so start having a go back telling him to grow up (apparently he was 32!) and we pack our things and leave.\nAs we leave the guy who’d moved us asks us to stay and back him up for when the police arrive. No thanks he’s your problem not ours mate.\nSo we end up camping in the van anyway in the middle of Dunedin. Not ideal.\nThis morning is a write-off as we are both too tired to do anything.\nThis afternoon is also a write-off, more of the van this time though. Very annoyingly we try to park in an underground carpark not realising the van is higher than the gap. Bugger bugger bugger bugger bugger. So we have a nice dent in the roof of the van that will need paying for. Looks like our trip will have to be cut shorter than we thought. Can’t be helped.\nIn the commotion we also lose the carpark ticket so get a lecture off the car park attendant about people losing their tickets and they should pay blah blah blah before finally giving us a spare one. (I find it inside the road atlas 5 mins after leaving the carpark).\nTo top it all off Matt has also found out today that GadgetTrak have decided to also create a “Stolen Camera Finder”. So now there’s some competition. Good news is his site will be mentioned in an article in The Economist. So there’s always a silver lining.\nIt is now 24 hours since we checked into that darn hostel and this is one day we wouldn’t mind being a groundhog one.\nLets hope the rest of the trip is less eventful. The rest of this day certainly will be as we’re parked up in a nice holiday park on the edge of Dunedin and we’re not leaving the van until the morning.\nOh Matt did get a full refund from the hostel in the end and turns out it was the guy’s mate that had been through his bag looking for something. He’d forgotten.

Above the clouds, sun illuminating the white snow. Enough time for photos and snowballs and Matt even made a mini-snowman.\nIt was enough time up there to enjoy it and get a buzz that has lasted 12 hours and I hope will last for years.\nWe landed just as the clouds drew in and blocked the sun from view.

Had a play with it yesterday and I’m finding the flash a bit harsh. Is there a top tip to minimise this?\n Firstly, if you’re using the camera in the day near natural light, the camera will be fine and it’s all down to your artistic flair.\nFor evening shots, I’ve written a bunch of tips, but really, there is only one:\n Borrow a Canon Speedlite that supports ETTL. (eg, the 430EXii or 580EXii).  Seriously. If you know someone into their photography that may have one you can borrow, give them a ring. Slap it on the camera, press “mode” until it says “ETTL” on the screen, aim the flash so the light bounces of a wall/ceiling to your subject (pool skills handy here) and snap away. The rest of the tips may help prevent you taking a load of unusable shots, but if you get a speedlite, you will take the best shots of the whole day (perhaps including the photographer’s).\nIf you can’t get a speedlite, my next-best advice is to wait for the sun to come up or get your subject under some other light source. On-camera flash is ugly, and unflattering. I have a top-end Canon and I never use the on-camera flash on people because they’ll just look sweaty and wrinkly. If you can get people next to a lamp or something, you’ll have much more luck.\nIf neither of those tips will help you, here are what I consider to be “last resort” tips:\n Prop camera against wall or on table for a steadier shot. Try self timer with camera on table. Form triangles with your body (tuck elbows in to sides) to become human tripod. Remember to look like a pro by cupping the lens with left hand palm upwards.  Anti-tips! Don’t do this:\n Raise the ISO above 800. Ideally, keep the ISO at 400 or lower unless you like grainy photos. Stick a Rizla to the flash. It will not soften the light, it just drinks the battery.  Keeping the camera steady will mean sharper shots, but if your subjects move, you’ll still get blurry shots. But I say go with it. Asking people to stay still means awkward faces. A blurry shot of someone laughing / dancing is a good thing if it’s deliberate.\nMy favourite wedding photos are always in the evening when people are relaxed (read: drunk). I’m sure you’ll capture some gems.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/blog/2011/06/14/tips-for-better-low-light-wedding-photos-with-an-canon-dslr/","summary":"I just got this in an email:\n A friend has asked me to take some of their wedding photos with their Canon 1000D.

The baby ones are so cute!\nNext stop on this windy rainy day was Punakaiki for the pancake rocks and blowholes. Unusual shaped rocks eroded by the thrashing waves.

The second in as many days. This time Montieth’s brewery tour and it was a little disappointing. They no longer brew beer there (as I had thought on day 237), just cider as it’s moved to their main factory in Timaru. So most of the factory was deserted. They’re also moving the cider production soon so they can close Greymouth down to revamp the whole place and reopen it with more sophisticated, automated production of fruit beers.\nStill we got to try 8 beers. Golden Lager is still a favourite of mine but quite liked the seasonal Fruit Harvest. Matt was keen on the Pilsner and neither of us liked the Black Lager as much as we thought we would. West Coast Brewing Co wins that one. So no beer was purchased today. Not sure it would have fitted in the fridge.\n1825 to 1875km Greymouth to Hokitika (Lake Mahinapua campsite)\nInstead of staying in Greymouth we decided to go straight on to a DOC campsite just south of Hokitika.\nWe discovered an interesting economical solution to having a separate train bridge and road bridge. Why not have two-in-one? One car/train carriage wide. With a cage covering the entire bridge? And it being dark added to the feeling of being in a suicidal scary movie. The signs said drive slowly.

Fog, cloud, sunshine, blue skies, fog.\nMustn’t forget the deer and the goats.\nMatt promptly legged it back to the van when the goats started advancing… Pulled up on the side of a road for another timelapse opportunity and to throw together some sarnies for lunch whilst the camera did its stuff. Sat in the back of our campervan it made me think of the holidays my mum described to me of when she was a young girl. The whole family, mum \u0026amp; dad \u0026amp; 6 kids would pile into the car with the caravan on tow to head to the seaside and stop in a layby to have a full feast with china plates, cups \u0026amp; saucers. Those were the days.\n   Had a choice of two freebie DOC campsites tonight. The one closest to Kaikoura is 6km up a gravel track along the Puhi Puhi river. It is probably beautiful in good weather but the fog had descended so the mountains were hardly visible and we decided to move to the next campsite. Except we’d pulled up on the grass and got bogged down in mud. My fault. I’d said go forward when Matt wanted to go backwards. There we were wheels spinning and throwing up mud. It took 30 mins to get out after Matt’s good idea of padding it with sticks \u0026amp; gravels and flooring it. I thought we’d be stuck there all night.\nSo we’re now at the 2nd choice further away from Kaikoura but we can just about see the sea out the back window and every so often a train comes rumbling by just between us and the coast.

He advised which roads weren’t closed and we were on our way.\nI cannot describe well enough how devastated Christchurch is. We walked along Asaph St, a main road about half a mile from Cathedral Square in the centre. Every road in the direction of the centre was cordoned off. Police, the army and barriers blockaded the access to the city. All along Asaph St we saw what an earthquake can do to buildings. Some had broken windows. Some had cracks down the walls. Some had chimneys missing. Some had whole walls missing. An entire row of shops, two storey high buildings, had no fronts left. They looked like smashed up dolls houses. A skyscraper in the centre was tilted.\nEvery building we passed had an inspection poster pinned to it. Green for OK, yellow for some damage, red for no-go area/condemned.\nIt took us 40mins to walk to our hostel on the corner of Barnardoes St \u0026amp; Gloucester St. It was a Tuesday afternoon in major city and we saw hardly any pedestrians and cars.\nOur hostel only opened back up on 2nd May. Luckily they had no structural damage but the whole road had been closed off since the quake. The authorities are trying to sort out Christchurch street by street and reducing the cordoned off area.

Think I’ll sleep fine as am completely spaced out from having half hour sleep in past 2 days.\nThey have a huge kitchen here, we actually get to cook for ourselves. The closest open supermarkets were 20mins away and on our way we passed a lovely old English-style building with two towers and a green glass dome. The dome was smashed and one of the towers had disintegrated exposing the rooms inside on all 3 levels. There was a crack right down the centre of the building to the lintel above the central doorway.\nFood is expensive here to buy. We had a shock when we saw how much a loaf of bread \u0026amp; 4 pints of milk were. Maybe twice what we pay at home.

It was basically a warehouse with an archaic projector and it had to be the worst documentary either of us have ever seen. It didn’t make sense. It didn’t flow. It was hard to tell who was who and when things happened as it jumped all over the place. Sometimes it had subtitles and you couldn’t see them because they blended into the background or were over the top of some other text on screen. The only new facts we learned were that the Vietnam war killed 600k and Khmer rouge killed a quarter of population in 3.5 years (1.75m). Insane stuff. It was such a shame because it is an opportunity to teach tourists about the true history of Cambodia and we came out more confused.\n And last but not least I must mention that Matt’s little SCF project has taken off!!

It’s a little like being back at home except it’s still roasting.\nAly had some bad news. During the storm on Saturday the lightning had struck everyone’s homes in the area killing everyone’s TVs, her stereo, modem and her husband’s PC. There is a phone mast just next door and so it must have attracted the lightning. In the UK I’m sure you wouldn’t see a mast so blatantly close to homes. It’s ridiculous. Aly is worried about the hazards for the children with the flooding and the play area being metal. It means more fund-raising is needed to make it safe for the coming months as the storms will only worsen.\nTried the hyper drink today. Every break-time the kids run round the back of the school to buy snacks \u0026amp; E number filled refreshments the lady with the ice crusher over the back fence.\nWhich means after break-time they’re hyperactive and it’s usually the best time to play a game as it’s rare they’ll sit still for more than 5 minutes.\nThe hyper drink is a plastic cup of crushed-ice with red syrup, some sweet goo \u0026amp; condensed milk over the top eaten with a brightly coloured plastic spoon. The vendor of such delights retrieves a large block of ice from her big ice chiller and grinds it down into shavings on a more sophisticated iron version of Mr. Frosty. It’s ingenious.\nI didn’t feel too well that evening, so I wonder if it was an overdose of sugar!\n Tuesday was the complete opposite weather wise. It was hot hot hot with clear blue skies. Matt was lovely and cool in our A/C room when I headed out into the heat and started burning up at 9am.\nI’m not sure what happened today. In in the morning class I had one of the youngest kids crying because he was being picked on by an older kid, muddy tears pouring down his cheek and then this afternoon another kid refusing to join in or listen. Maybe it was the heat. I don’t know if I helped either situation at all. Having some woman babbling to you in a language you don’t quite understand when you’re upset can’t be that good. Both managed to come round and start smiling again thankfully. And Dyna the second boy managed to snap out of it enough to start a game of hangman with me at break-time to distract me from marking the homework. 😀\n Wednesday I found a hit of a game. A variation on Boggle which I borrowed from a UK kids website. I wrote a 4 x 5 table of letters on the board including letters of words I had taught this week. They had to try and come up with words using the letters in the table and they got a point for each letter. They started looking at the dictionary and writing words up their arms to get as many as possible. An organised game soon turned to chaos. But hey they were having fun and learning new words!\n Today, was my last day at SHAC and it was sad. Not because my fan design was terrible and one of the kids had to show me how to make a better one. We all made fans because it was stifling hot in the classroom. And not because I managed to lose all of my games of Thumb War, even with the tiniest girl in the class. Even reading a book to them was a hit for once. My earlier attempts of reading had gone down like a ton of bricks. They loved The Snowball and I loved reading it to them. It was sad because they genuinely acted like they didn’t want me to leave. Although it could have been the sweets I’d brought in and used as bribes when they behaved themselves 😀 I’d had a few hugs during the past couple weeks but this time I had a massive group hug from eight of the smallest kids in one go. It was so sweet.\nAfter class we had a mass photo of me with all the kids doing the smiling hearts symbol and Christina and Dyna (the boy who had been upset in my class on Tuesday) just didn’t want to let go. I had to keep the tears back.\nNathaly asked me when was I coming back. I had to truthfully say I didn’t know but I hope to one day. I really do. I wish I could have stayed longer.\nAs I left she and Christina brought me the hugest bunches of wild purple flowers that filled the basket on my bike. Just down the road another girl gave me a yellow flower and yet another girl gave me a bunch of leaves.\nMy morning classMy afternoon classOther memories of SHAC\nThrowing a paper ball to start a conversation practice session and hitting a kid on the head with it straightaway.\nBuying the SHAC volunteer T-shirt and wearing it with pride, really feeling part of it.\nBeing welcomed by Aly and her family so openly and fully.\nGetting lots of high fives.\nThe natural generosity of the kids. Earlier this week I was humbled by one of the girls giving me a packet of Snack Bi-Do (like Skips) as a present. She’s a bit of a tomboy and always comes to school with mud on her face and appears very poor.\nMatt became addicted to them so I queued up with the kids at the local shop to buy in bulk.I’d been given a packet of dried peas by the girl who beat me at Thumb Wars and postcards of Angkor Wat by another girl who had only been in my class twice. I assumed she’d been away with her family for Khmer New Year.\nMy journey to and from SHAC. Each day I became more familiar to the people I passed and so would get hellos from different people. And lots of “hello teacher”. Especially at one of the small communes where Aly told me 9 families lived in a number of wooden houses. They’d had no toilet until she managed to get the money together and had recently built two toilets inside the commune. As I passed on my last day leaving SHAC the tiny children who normally shout out came running out to say hello to me. They couldn’t have been more than 3 years old. All five of them were barely dressed and had muddy blotches here and there but all five of them were beaming with the biggest grins. I put my hand out to them and they all started holding my hand. It was such a lovely experience. I would like to have a photo to share that moment with everyone but I didn’t want to get my camera out and ruin the moment. Instead I have that wonderful unspoilt memory to myself.\nAnother striking experience happened moments after as I got off my bike to avoid some pot-holes just as a young boy came out of his house. He was smiling at me so I said “high 5” and as I put my hand up he flinched away. I lowered my hand so he could clap it and then tried high-5 again and he did it and grinned. I was so relieved. It shocked me that his first reaction was that I was going to hit him. It seems that happens a lot here.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/05/19/day-224-to-227-monday-25th-to-thursday-28th-april-2nd-week-teaching-at-shac/","summary":"Monday back to school and whilst UK basks in hot sunny weather on a bank holiday we get rain so the cycle there is nice and muddy.

He works at Palm Garden Lodge and had invited us a few days ago. He was providing the food and we’d provide the beer.\nAt 3:30 when Samoeun finished work he took us off in his friend’s tuk-tuk to his home in another village on the outskirts of Siem Reap near West Baray. Stopped off on the way for a couple of crates of beer and a block of ice in a carrier bag.\nWe met his father who was an amputee and his step-mother. Also his two sisters that we’d not realised also worked at Palm Garden Lodge and made our breakfast every day.\nWe took American cookies as a present. Neither of knew for sure if that was apt but we were new to this.\nMatt \u0026amp; I were given fresh coconuts to drink straightaway. I don’t know who but someone climbed up a tree and chopped them down especially for us. They put their electric fan on to cool us down and his dad instantly electrocuted himself with the dodgy wiring.\nThe beer and ice went into a big cool box and the food arrived by moped. Chicken pieces with spicy sauce, lemongrass \u0026amp; garlic chicken, salad and Khmer soup. The soup of coconut milk \u0026amp; noodles they’d only ordered specifically for Matt \u0026amp; I because we’d not tried it before.\nWe all sat there on a bamboo mat in front of their house eating \u0026amp; drinking Angkor with ice. Every sip “Chul moy, chul moy” (cheers). Watching the chickens \u0026amp; their chicks run across our dishes of food as the dogs chased them and the chickens retaliated and ran at the dogs. The cats lay around contented whilst the dogs either ignored them or licked them.\n[This photo has clearly been edited to make Matt’s legs look longer, whiter and skinnier than normal –Ed]\nThen the dancing started. Samoeun’s brother had brought over Khmer \u0026amp; Thai karaoke DVDs and Samoeun, obviously a keen dancer, grabbed Matt and up they were jigging about. Then it was my turn.\nMore and more neighbours appeared and it really was a party. We had to get another crate of beer of course.\nHad to leave at 8pm with our slightly tipsy tuk-tuk driver as I had to get up to teach the next morning but we wish we could have stayed longer. By that that time the whole neighbourhood seemed to have appeared. Although I felt outnumbered as they were all men.\nIt was good to meet Samoeun’s family and see where he lived. It’s an eye-opener to be in such a gorgeous setting – next to paddie fields, surrounded by palm trees – and see a tiny wooden home on stilts for 5 adults. No toilet. Just a piece of material to hide your modesty in the banana trees next to the chicken coop \u0026amp; pigsty. And a good community where everyone knows each other and helps each other out.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/05/16/day-223-sunday-23rd-april-samoeuns-family-party/","summary":"Sunday was party day at Samoeun’s house.

Many of them have orders already from different companies. Many have their own “niche” of basket weaving. It depends whom they have learnt from.\nThis family of weavers made small basket for holding pencils and the like. They charged 1,000 riel (25¢) for a pot, Aly \u0026amp; I bought one each and she may come back to get more. They were beautifully made. \nNext door they wove toilet roll holders for $3 each. It was too expensive for our pockets but the lady there already had an American buyer so why charge any less?\nThis family were weaving large baskets on their doorstep for $2.50 each. The guy is stripping the wood and sizing it. The lady is making it into a saleable item. It takes a day to make one basket.\nThese baskets are filled with fruit and gifts as presents for people.\nWe met a group of women making rice wine holders. They had been given a sample box and were trying to copy it with the Angkor Wat temple woven on it. They were charging 3,000 riel (75¢) for each rice wine holder. Matt and I had seen the same holder sold in a Siem Reap supermarket with including a bottle of rice wine for $11. Rice wine is normally $4 to $5 per bottle.\n Aly showed me the land she owned nearby where she wishes to build a home for her family away from the city.\nShe also took me to a shop selling traditional local goods for a lot more money than they’d paid the local people for.\nAnd we popped to her old school in Siem Reap where she used to teach before opening up her own school to pick up her young daughter Sandra so then there were were 3 on the moped.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/05/16/day-222-saturday-22nd-april-another-side-to-siem-reap/","summary":"Saturday I went off for the morning with Aly to what I thought was advertising her charity in town.

I cycle there and back twice a day. It’s only just over 1km away down mud tracks, past a mixture of large houses and small wooden houses on stilts. Men \u0026amp; boys sit at the side of the polluted streams that run through the village with their fishing rods hoping to catch something. This is about 1km from the fancy tourist centre of Siem Reap.\nIn Aly’s backyard there are 3 classrooms and a teacher’s room with a small library of Khmer \u0026amp; English school books. The rooms are open to the elements as they’re made of criss-crossed bamboo. When it rains they have plastic sheeting to cover the sides of the rooms.\nI’m teaching grade 2 aged from 7 to 11. They know simple vocab and I need to teach them simple sentences and additional vocab. You never realise how your accent sounds until you have 15 kids repeating a word like toothbrush or fork verbatim back to you. I now say “tooth” all proper like.\nIt’s hard work. Much harder than in Laos. I have the same kids everyday for a 2 hour class rather than different kids for 1 hour. It’s a challenge trying to think of lesson plans and homework everyday. On the other hand it’s so good because I’m getting to know the kids really well. I am awful at remembering their names but I’m learning their characters and their learning styles. It’s also interesting because I aim to teach the same lesson in the afternoon as in the morning because they’re a different class learning the same vocab. But a lesson that works well in the morning can be a complete disaster in the afternoon and vice versa.\nSome of it has to do with the help I get from Nathaly and Christina. They are two of Aly’s daughters who attend the lessons and help with translation between me and the kids when needed. Nathaly is on the left, Christina on the right.\nIf they’re not there it can be funny trying to get the class to understand a concept or game. But it gets me thinking on my feet and sometimes we end up adapting a game for the better.\nSo games have been a mixture of success \u0026amp; failure. They’re an essential part of the lesson. If they’re sitting there too long listening, writing or learning new vocab they’ll start shouting “game game game”.\nHangman was quite successful. Though the first time we played it they thought they had to guess the word straightaway. And usually did!\nChinese whispers turned into yelling the word from one end of the line to the other.\nThe memory game was great fun. This is a pretty well-known idea. I had loads of items like a pen, pencil, toothbrush, eraser, book, fork, spoon, etc under a sheet. There were 2 teams and 1 from each team had to look away whilst I removed an item. They then had to look back and I’d remove the sheet and they had to remember which item was missing. For some reason the afternoon class thought the game was to grab as many items as possible from the table. I had 12 kids scrabbling on the table all at the same time. I couldn’t help but laugh.\nIn between lessons I’ve been giving Aly a hand with corresponding with donors. She is constantly working on raising money or getting school supplies or arranging volunteers or organising everything else.\nThursday I stayed at the school all day. Just as the class ended the rains came and I had no bike that day or any waterproofs. The playground quickly filled with water and Aly’s kids plus a few of the schoolkids that stayed behind enjoyed skidding and splashing about in it. They were caked in mud and laughing their heads off. I wish I could have joined them!\nAly invited me to join her family for lunch. Delicious marinated pepper beef, rice and salad with a Cambodian spicy sauce followed by fresh watermelon. She showed me pictures of the floods last year where her kids were swimming in her backyard. The whole village floods every summer in their area. At least waist deep.\nShe’s also invited me to go to one of the local towns with her on Saturday. Really looking forward to it.\n And Matt? Yes he did leave the room at least twice this week 😉\nWe got into a routine and I would leave him after breakfast each morning to start coding whilst I went to school and back via the local market to get bread and supplies for lunch. I’d arrive back after 3 hours and he wouldn’t have moved. I’d help out with anything I could with SCF and we’d have a random sarnie whilst listening to half an Adam \u0026amp; Joe podcast before I left him in peace again for school.\nWe had one or two nights out including one where I managed to have another tree frog take a liking to me. It landed on the table next to me and when Matt poked his camera in its face it used me as a springboard to escape back to the more familiar surroundings of the leafy plant behind me.\nTeaching is exhausting work so many evenings we just stayed in and chilled. I don’t know how full-time teachers do it every day. No wonder you need such long school holidays!\nIt’s so rewarding though and good fun.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/05/16/day-217-to-221-monday-18th-to-friday-22nd-april-siem-reap-week-1-of-english-teaching-at-shac-smilinghearts/","summary":"I have been teaching every day from 9:30 to 11:30 and from 15:30 to 17:30 at the shac-smilinghearts school set up by Aly which opened on November 1st 2010.

We think the red is related to the Khmer New Year this week.\nWednesday rainy all morning and then boiling at lunchtime. Not sure our fan room is going to cut it.

I visit SHAC about 1km from where we’re staying and love it. Aly who set up the charity is a local woman (and teacher) who has basically built a school and playground in her back garden. 100 kids of all ages come to learn English there. They are either orphaned, poor or have HIV/AIDS and cannot afford their own schooling without her help. It’s amazing. I start on Monday. Today was the climax for the new year.

By halfway 4 of us were sat on the same seat.\nThe tuk-tuk driver from the station unsurprisingly dropped us off at the “immigration office” on the Thai side where they want you to fill in Cambodian visa forms and hand over fees. I’d read about this place just the day before (the white building on the right as you approach the border) and we left immediately. We already had our online visas and they were trying to get us to fill in paperwork anyway. I also told another couple who promptly left. There is no need to do anything on the Thai side of the border for Cambodia. If you don’t have a visa you get it on the Cambodian side. It is a con.\nThe journey across the border took longer than anticipated. For some reason checking out of Thailand took longer than checking in. The Cambodian side wasn’t too bad though. A half hour wait I’d say in a tiny room.\nThen the fun began. A guy got us onto a free shuttle to the bus station. Except it wasn’t a bus station of the sort most people know. It was a building that looked like it had different bus companies selling tickets but as soon as you tried to ask them about tickets to Siem Reap they said ask the guy over there. I.e. the guy who was trying to get us on a minibus to Siem Reap because the “government bus” wasn’t due for another 90mins.\nWe weren’t having any of it until some other travellers asked us if we’d join them so they’d have a full minibus. Once the bus was full they could head off. OK we agreed to get going as we didn’t know really how long we’d be waiting for.\nThey told us it would take 2hrs 20 – quicker than the 3hr government bus. It took us over 3hours. Because we stopped at a restaurant about 50km away from Siem Reap. One couple ordered food. It was pointless and expensive. I was not happy. I was knackered from travelling for so long and knowing that Siem Reap was only around the corner frustrated me even more. Why do these companies do this to tourists? Piss them off on purpose? Why not charge a bit extra and get us there quicker? Pathetic.\nI was so glad we knew what we were doing once we got to Siem Reap.

And with Matt keen to get on with www.stolencamerafinder.com we pottered about doing not much at all except that.\nWednesday night we tried a kooky restaurant called Cabbages \u0026amp; Condoms in Sukhumvit. It’s a restaurant that gives some of its profits to HIV/AIDS charities. You eat in a lovely garden setting surrounded by trees filled with lanterns. The quirky thing is that the lampshades are made from condoms. And they have mannequins stood everywhere with different outfits on, all made from condoms. Very creative.\nThe final touch, instead of an after-dinner mint, you get to take home a free condom. Ingenious.\nMatt enjoying his dinner at Cabbages \u0026amp; CondomsCondom clad santa clausWhilst looking for a birthday card for Matt’s niece Lily Scarlett we found an arcade with that basketball game where you have to score as many baskets as possible in 2 mins. Haven’t played that in years. Needless to say both of us were abysmal in comparison to the guys next to us. 79 to 250-something.\nAfter 5 nights in Sunflower Place and because we are staying Bangkok we decide to find something cheaper. Amazingly we find Unico Express in Sukhumvit for 540THB per night and book for 3 nights. It has a flat-screen TV, a mini-bar and an outdoor swimming pool. Plus with 12% off via hotels.com via quidco.com we’re laughing. They must have got their prices wrong.\nOK it’s not in the best of locations. 15 mins walk from Sukhumvit Road which turns out to be chocca-block with girlie bars. Hmmm not great. But we manage to find Cheap Charlie’s bar a bit further away, another quirky place built on a street corner selling cheap Chang.\nWe have been in Bangkok over a week now and I start to get cabin fever and kind of wish I’d headed down south with W \u0026amp; S. But then again I think how often do they get a holiday just the two of them. So it’s a good thing really. But I don’t have much to occupy myself whilst Matt is trying to make our millions. Then I have a brainwave. If I have my own laptop I can help him more easily with SCF.\nSo after taking at least 2 seconds to convince Matt it’s a good investment whilst we’re travelling on a budget we head to Fortune mall, a computer geek’s paradise. Honestly if I hadn’t have been there Matt would have spent a small fortune.\nWe’d left our shopping expedition a little late so everything was closing. But we found an ideal netbook and went back to investigate online. (yawn)\nIt seemed a good deal so the next day we were back at Fortune mall buying our little bargain of an Acer netbook from Tesco Lotus (yes Tescos can you believe it they are officially taking over the world).\nAnyway that shut me up for a little while and Matt got back to SCF coding whilst we waited for Wend \u0026amp; Steve to return.\nAnd on Thursday we return to Sunflower Place for 3 reasons. 1. because Unico had twigged and doubled their prices. 2. because it was back to where we thought W \u0026amp; S would be staying. 3. because we know the area and we like the Japanese ramen noodle place on Silom Road. They do delicious slow-cooked beef \u0026amp; pork ribs plus Chrysanthemum tea. And around the corner at Sala Daeng station there is the juice bar with Guava juice and Passionfruit \u0026amp; beetroot juice. Mmmmm.\nBy the way the weather has started to improve at last.

What a place. So swanky. I’m going to sound like a complete child now but it had proper porters take our luggage to the room on one of those brass wheelie things. The bed is huge! The desk has one of those green lamps on it. There are satin dressing gowns and slippers. And a trouser press. Luxury. We feel like right scruffs.\nAfter much umming and ahhing a bit of shopping in MBK for smart shoes (that’ll get him into nice bars) for Matt and some extremely sweet iced plum tea from a lovely little iced tea shack in Siam we trundle off to meet Wend \u0026amp; Steve at the airport as a surprise. As much of a surprise for us is receiving a text from Wendy saying they’d landed and there we were 2o mins from the airport. They were early.\nUrging the skytrain to move faster I tell Wend we’ll see her at the hotel and we finally arrive at the airport and leg it to arrivals. Just as they pootle down the travelator towards us we duck into a confused group of Japanese tourists and jump out from behind a pillar Surprise!! Sometimes we are so jammy.\nW \u0026amp; S are a bit jet-lagged so we leave them to chill for a while until we meet at the roof-top terrace bar next to the roof-top pool \u0026amp; jacuzzi and have our complimentary orange juice plus obligatory beer. Hooray Wend \u0026amp; Steve are here! Shame it’s so bloomin gloomy. The weather in Bangkok has taken a turn for the worst, grey skies have set in and it’s decidedly chilly.\nAh well a couple more beers and we have our coats on and find some street-food. The most extravagant street-food in Bangkok we guarantee. Somehow we are sat outside a 7-11 at plastic tables with bottles of Singha (the same 7-11 the guy serving us just went into the shop to buy) and we are dished up a feast of seafood, 2 whole fish, squid, veggies, beef something or other and rice. The dishes never seemed to stop coming! No idea how that happened. The bill was more extravagant too. But hey we’re on our holidays now!\nMonday we meet up with Wend \u0026amp; Steve and head on the boat to the Grand Palace \u0026amp; Wat Pho.\nWe have all made sure we’re wearing the right kind of clothes this time. I am not going to be accused of breaking the rules again.\nMatt gives Wend a lesson on how to use her 5-year old SLR. One of the guards in the Royal Palace. Honestly this guy is real and life-size. The elephants on the other hand are not.\nGuard no. 2 was ecstatic to be having his photo taken with two beautiful women.\nMatt gets a close up – guard no. 3 trying not to smile for the camera. Recognise this? We all went to Wat Pho. Although Matt \u0026amp; I had already been there we didn’t mind going again as it is such an amazing place. It was strange seeing it again though as it was under renovation so many of the statues outside had been removed and the buildings were covered in scaffolding. Also after spending a few hours at the Royal Palace it’s easy to see how you can get templed out and Wat Pho to not seem so impressive. But Matt \u0026amp; I still think it’s the better of the two. And 7x cheaper.\nLunch at the local market was an experience for W \u0026amp; S. The women serving don’t write anything down. They just shout it at the people cooking. There’s a lot of yelling going on everywhere. We all end up with exactly what we ordered.\nAfter a busy day sight-seeing it was only right that we went out for relaxing cocktails at one of the coolest bars in Bangkok – Moon Bar at Vertigo in the Banyan Tree hotel.\nThe last time Matt \u0026amp; I tried to get in here we were turned away for not meeting the dress code. This time we felt like Julia Roberts going back to the shop after buying a good dress. OK so we went back to the same place but it was so worth it. This bar is absolutely amazing. I cannot recommend it enough. An open-top classy rooftop bar with only glass barriers to stop you falling over the edge, views across the whole city and the best cocktails. Yes it was cold (for the first time ever in Bangkok it was bloody freezing) and a bit breezy but we loved it.\nThe rest of the evening, as we were in Silom, we felt obliged to try the local entertainment of Patpong market. I won’t go into much detail here. Our first bar was disappointing. the second was definitely entertaining and the sights were both incredible and laughable.\nPatpong market was almost packed up when we emerged and we all were in need of a lie-in. Although Matt, Wendy \u0026amp; I managed to get down to breakfast. I was the only one to manage a full fry-up whereas Matt had 2 pieces of fruit. 😀\nAn alternative early-morning view of Patpong market. Wendy \u0026amp; Steve were meant to be going to Krabi today but the whole of South Thailand is flooded and there is still torrential rain. They don’t think they can get to Railay or Koh Phi Phi or Koh Lanta, all are only accessible by boat, so have decided to stay in Bangkok another night and decide what to do.\nMatt \u0026amp; I moved back around the corner to Sunflower Place as we couldn’t afford to stay in Siam Heritage again.\nWe all went for a walk around Chinatown, ended going completely the wrong way and so back-tracked through the backstreets of Chinatown which was an eclectic mix of mechanical works. I have never seen so many piles of engine parts, cogs and scrap metal.\nFound a lush little dim-sum restaurant where Wend \u0026amp; I pigged out but the boys couldn’t manage anything too substantial. Maybe we’re more used to cocktails than they are?\nWe ventured further into Chinatown’s tiny alleyways of shops selling anything and everything. Including a hat shop where you weren’t allowed to try on the hats. Needless to say we didn’t buy anything from there.\nEven in the tiniest streets the mopeds are always there. Wend was keen to do more shopping so we took them over to MBK. Not sure it was the right kind of place to hang around with hangovers. It wasn’t very successful. I think a grand total of 1 pair of flipflops and 1 SD card was purchased. (The SD card though did come in handy as it allowed Wend to take a million and one photos instead of restricting herself to a few each day – sorry Steve 😉).\nTried abysmally to find a good pizza place for their last night but failed. The good place was closed by the time we got our backsides in gear and so ended up in an empty pizza place which was dire. I have no idea how some restaurants stay open long at all when their food is mediocre.\nWend \u0026amp; Steve are off down south tomorrow in search of sand and sea so we said our goodbyes tonight as they’re getting an early train and although I like to think I can get up early to say bye I know I can’t.\nBefore they left though we managed to palm our teapot off on them. Left it Siam for when they get back so they can take it home. Result! Thanks Wend for offering to take it. You’re a lifesaver 😀\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/05/13/please-check-photos-day-195-to-197-sunday-27th-to-tuesday-29th-march-bangkok-wendy-steve-arrive/","summary":"Sunday we checked out of Sunflower Place and into Siam Heritage kindly paid for by W \u0026amp; S for our joint birthday pressies.

Hangovers from hell. I think we went to sleep about 5am and were up and out in the midday sun packed and waiting for a bus to Battambang. Not pretty.\nLuckily the bus journey to Battambang was a bearable 3.5 hours. And trusting a tuk-tuk driver (Mr Bat from Battambang) at the bus stop paid off. The first hotel was full (an LP recommendation) so ended up at its sister hotel Asia Hotel a bit further away but one of the best places we’ve stayed in for comfort and cleanliness and wifi and a steal at $8 a night.\nDidn’t move for the rest of the day. Hangover took control. Like vampires we only ventured out after dark and only 100yards down the street to the nearest restaurant for dinner as once again the torrential rain and stormy weather appeared from nowhere. No matter we were the only occupants of the restaurant. Food was pleasant and we were in no mood for traipsing around.\nThursday I didn’t feel too good again which resulted in another non-eventful day apart from essential lunch \u0026amp; dinner. We did however get ripped off at the market where 4 oranges cost us $2 and we also found The Smoking Pot where they do cooking classes so may be doing that tomorrow. Hoping the weather will be better tomorrow too as pretty stormy again.\nBattambang has no real sights in town so no exciting photos I’m afraid. But it has a good ambience. It’s not too touristy yet. Has a real wholesome feeling. No fakeness like Siem Reap.\nFriday we got active \u0026amp; tootled off with Mr Bat.\nWe “did” the bamboo train. Our attempt at negotiating with the “owner” of the bamboo train for a deal for 4 of us failed. It costs $5 per person regardless of how many people get on one train. We ended up deciding to go with another couple who were there trying to negotiate a price too. Our logic was that more people on one train would mean less petrol than two trains and save them money.\nLittle did we know that the drivers only get paid the same ($1) whatever and the “owners” \u0026amp; police take the rest of the cash regardless of what we pay. So taking 2 may have been more beneficial to the drivers.\nThe bamboo train is a quirky form of transport for locals. No passenger trains run in Cambodia at the moment so to get around the locals use bamboo platforms on double metal wheels (kind of like those ones you get in a kinder-egg or McDonalds happy meal to make a car) powered by small engines and pootle along the tracks between O Dambong and O Sra Lav.\nThere is only a single track so if you meet one coming the other way one of the “trains” is dismantled and rebuilt the other side.\n  We didn’t meet one on the way but did on the way back.\nAt O Sra Lav village we met Sherai and several kids who made us grass bracelets and rings. Sherai let us look around her brick making factory – comprising of a few thatched covered areas next to a clay pit and 2 large brick kilns.\nWe met this chap who was cutting the clay from the earth and piling it up ready to put in the brick mould.\nWe sat with Sherai and heard her story from Khmer Rouge times. She had been 8 years old when her parents and brother were taken away. Cut throats. Bound by hands and feet to a wooden pole and taken away never to be seen again. Tears welled in her eyes immediately. It was harrowing to listen to. And all she kept doing was apologising to us for her bad English (which was fine), weaving us grass crickets and feeding us fresh mango picked from the trees across the village. I tried to give her some money towards the mangoes and she wouldn’t take it saying give it to your driver.\nWe were only meant to spend 15mins there but it turned into 45mins. I could have stayed there for hours listening to her. So honest. I mean she must meet a lot of tourists. But unless she is as an excellent actress I cannot comprehend what she has been through. And I wish I understood it more. To both of us there seem so many unanswered questions about the 70s. How it all started. Why it happened. I mean it wasn’t that long after the Vietnam war and the American’s bombing half of Cambodia (killing 600k) \u0026amp; Laos (killing 100k).\nOn our way back we met an oncoming bamboo train so the opposition surrendered and swapped their platform to the track behind us.\nOff one-side Back on the other\nBack at the embarking station we gave the driver a tip to help with his measly $1 wage and then heard the story that the “owners” are in fact 40 families in that village that rotate each day. All income is split between these families. The police are involved. As always in Cambodia. But perhaps everyone is fighting to survive. I don’t doubt that people from each village sees it as a con. It’s all a con. But it seems that everyone is out to get as much as possible from the tourists because that’s all they can get.\nNext stop was Phnom Sampeau. Mr Bat became our impromptu guide walking with us up this superficial looking hill smack in the middle of the flattest land we’ve ever seen. This lump of limestone seemed unnatural. Mr Bat explained that most of this area of Cambodia used to be part of the sea hence the flatness. But why this random hill and a second one in the distance but none others to speak off for miles around? No-one knows.\nThe Wat had been turned into a prison by the Khmer Rouge and then back into a Wat afterwards. Men were currently re-painting it with vivid depictions of Buddhist stories.\nThe Killing Caves were both spectacular and harrowing. These huge natural caves on top of a hill with steps going down into them built by monks to lead to shrines had been turned into a place of death by the Khmer Rouge. A hole in the top was where KR soldiers beat over the head and pushed their victims into the cave below. A glass cabinet displayed some skulls from victims there. An old German/Russian gun bought by the Cambodian government still lies at the top of the hill too where it was used to fire at the Khmer Rouge.\n   The Killing Caves\n Nearby a ginormous Buddha head is partially carved into the side of the hill. The project ran out of money before it was finished. It looks like he’s been buried in the rock and can’t get out. (We missed the photo opportunity here so just imagine).\n Now that was just the morning. We managed to get back in time for our afternoon Cambodian cooking class at the Smoking Pot.\nA truly authentic trip to the market where we actually bought what we were going to cook.\nSnake fish (we think) that one minute were splashing about in a washing up bowl were slapped on a scales, then onto a chopping board, whacked over the head with the back of a cleaver, skinned, gutted and filleted and placed in a plastic bag. The bloodied heads were also retrieved and kept to be carried by yours truly back to the restaurant to be used for stock. Yum yum.\nAt least ours were definitely dead. A nearby fishmonger had a skinned fish on a board that was still moving.\nMade Beef Loklak, Fish Amok and Chicken \u0026amp; Lemongrass soup. All delicious. Perhaps too many bird-shit chillies (this is what birds-eye chillies are really called as the seeds are eaten by birds and grow in their droppings) in the soup which I almost choked on but lovely all the same. Also amazing cookbook with so much useful info about fresh ingredients. Can’t wait to get home and start cooking! (Well after New Zealand and Australia of course :) Such a bargain cooking class for $8. Especially as there were only 4 of us in the class. Highly recommend it if you’re ever in Battambang.\nOff to Bangkok tomorrow via the infamous Poipet border crossing.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/05/10/day-191-to-193-wednesday-23rd-to-friday-25th-march-battambang-bamboo-train-cambodian-cooking-class/","summary":"Yes I was right.

By about 2am, whilst the tuk-tuk touts donned their waterproofs and tried to hide, a couple of drinkers started dancing in the street which caught on pretty quickly and there were loads of us – tourists \u0026amp; streetkids – dancing and splashing about outside the club as the water filled the street and Black Eyed Peas – Tonight’s gonna be a good night – boomed from the stereo.

Clean and pruned alongside the Royal residence. Not so pretty further upstream with wooden shack homes over the banks and piles of rubbish being collected by locals in riverboats. Possibly a new way of recycling?\nThe rains threatened us again and we ducked into a restaurant for 50c beer just in the nick of time.

It’s kind of like a drive-thru. Your tuk-tuk pulls up in front of the kiosks, you queue for a couple of minutes, get your photo taken on a webcam and they print your ticket. You hop back on your tuk tuk and you’re away. The weird bit is the fact you can buy a 1 day ticket for $20 or a 3-day ticket for $40. We only wanted to do 2 days so it worked out the same either way. The second weird bit is you can get a 3-day consecutive ticket or an any 3 days in a 7-day period ticket for the same price. Why have both?!\nAnyway off we tootle with Mr. Long 35km to Banteay Srei which was pretty amazing. Very ornate carvings. It was worth the trip and was one of our favourite temples.\nOn the way back to the main temple area we stopped at the Cambodian Landmine museum set up by a guy with the most incredible past.

Go lie on the beach all day of course.\nWe hadn’t seen the sea since New Year in Thailand and it sounds sad but it was really exciting. Being by the Mekong is lovely but you just can’t beat seeing the sea stretch out to the horizon merging with the blue sky and the sound of waves on the sand. Lush.\nIt was too hot to be in the sun all day so we snoozed on loungers with a sun umbrella protecting us. Or so we thought. Red bits and tan lines ahoy.\nMatt cooling offThe beach is lovely but you can’t relax for very long. We were shocked at how many people including kids spend their days walking up and down touting for business. Massage mister, manicure / pedicure lady, women offering to thread my armpits. Um no thanks. I’m lying on a beach in public and its boiling hot. Why would you want to go near my armpits?\nThey sold fruit, mini lobsters (delicious by the way) and barbequed squid on sticks. One woman had a mobile bar-b-q. She had a wooden pole across her shoulder. One end carried the ice-box and utensils. Hanging from the other end was a bar-b-q bucket with hot coals, a grill and some squid sat there sizzling away. We could feel the heat from a couple of metres away she must have been cooking herself at the same time.\nOne girl was quite funny. She came and sat next to me, took one look at my grey hair and smiled. Then proceeded to start pulling them out one by one. After three I had to ask her to stop otherwise I think she would have continued until I was bald.\nA guy also asked us our ages and again commented “young face, old hair”. I am definitely dying my hair at the next opportunity!\n There are a lot of children trying to sell you bracelets during the day and fireworks at night. I had one boy chatting to me who made me what he called a good-luck bracelet for free which I didn’t want. He got stroppy then because I was disrespecting his country. It is so sad that they have to do this. They say they go to school but you see them wandering around the beaches at all hours.\nAnd there are many disabled men begging on the beach at night. Many have been maimed by landmines. They don’t get welfare.\nThe only real way to help is give money to the local charities so that you know its going to the right place. But we felt so bad. We as wealthy tourists sitting there relaxing on their beach spending money on food and drink while so many locals are struggling to survive.\nOn St Patricks Day we decided to try the 25c beer at Utopia. This is a place recommended in the LP and it seemed quite a normal bar when we went in there.\nGreen lager lager lagerOnce happy hour had ended we looked up from our half-pints to find the place had turned a little seedy. Everywhere you looked there were young girls in tiny dresses loitering around lardy western guys. And these guys were all ages. I suddenly felt out of place in my vest top and baggy trousers. Once again the western world is having a negative influence on other countries.\nAmazing Friday spent on a posh boat tour. Snorkelling in the morning, freshly cooked lunch on-board, tea-coloured river walk in the afternoon and lazing on the most gorgeous beach ever.\nAt the snorkelling point Matt joined a few other guys in daring to jump off the top of the boat into the sea. I was a wimp. Managed to climb over the barrier but couldn’t bring myself to jump. Silly as Wendy \u0026amp; I used to jump off the coves in Menorca when we were younger.\n  After lunch the boat anchored offshore of Koh Rong Samloem island and we could choose to swim or take the speedboat. I decided to swim. I’m not a strong swimmer and wasn’t sure if I could make it but sometimes you just have to go for it. And after not jumping off the boat I was out to prove something. The water was crystal clear and so warm. And luckily for me shallow after about 25metres of swimming.\nThey took us on a half hour walk through tea-coloured river up to our waists and sometimes deeper to learn about mangroves and other plants growing in this area. My flip-flop broke as soon as we entered the water so I was bare-foot. I hate not knowing what’s in the water I’m in so this was a pulse-raising experience for me. I’m sure something brushed past my leg a few times.\nWe skipped the rainforest walk and so glad we did. Instead spent half hour on the practically deserted beach and swimming in the sea. We never get to go in the water together really as we’re always worried about someone stealing our stuff. It was lush.\nAs soon as they came back from their walk we had to swim back to the boat and the beach time had been our favourite part of the trip.\nChilling on the way back Our last day in Sihanoukville was a non-event. Had a sleeper bus booked for 8pm to Siem Reap so once we checked out we sat in the Cool Banana bar all day long using their wifi and watching their projector.\nThe sleeper bus was bizarre. Nothing like the one from Hampi to Goa in India. There were two levels of completely reclined seats. We were on the bottom level and couldn’t really sit up. The lights didn’t work either so you had no choice but to go to sleep if you had no torch. The on-board deluxe toilet was revolting. And the bus driver was a maniac. Sitting up whilst a coach is over-taking and swerving in the dead of night is definitely more palatable than lying down. Oh well another day another interesting experience and we’re still here to bore everyone with the tales.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/04/13/day-184-to-187-wednesday-16th-to-saturday-19th-march-sihanoukville/","summary":"What do you do when you’re at the seaside?

It took us less than an hour to be unimpressed by it. The Silver Pagoda is famed for its solid silver floor. We expected sparkling, dazzling. We got dull, scratched. Only a small amount was uncovered and “on display”, half of which was held down with masking tape. In definite need of some TLC \u0026amp; Silvo.\nThe buildings in the grounds are fantastic but we have seen so many temples that it’s difficult to be awestruck anymore. Especially at $6.25 a ticket. (I’ve become some a grouch when it comes to money.)\nRoyal PalaceSightseeing monkey family. “Ooh Malcolm look at those delicate carverings”, mum said. Poor Malcolm was too little to see over the clippered hedgerow and could only imagine the wonders she was marvelling at. Matt admiring the wedding cake topiary Matt’s close-up view of the topiary Fours hour later we were by the seaside in Sihanoukville. We found a smart little motel type place 2 mins walk from the beach and managed to barter him down to $8 a night. Trick is to just start walking away. There are plenty of places to stay there.\nSihanoukville is under a lot of redevelopment. The roads have piles of rubble, the pavements are half finished and there a number of large hotels under construction. But once you get to the beach its a different story. It is full of ramshackle beach bar restaurants. As far as the eye can see the beach is lined with tables and chairs, sunloungers and sun umbrellas. All the bars offering standard “Western” food (don’t get me started on this topic) and happy hour beers. Rather like Phuket but less busy and somehow a better atmosphere.\nCambodia is ridiculously cheap for beer. If you’re paying $1 for a glass of draught you’re paying too much. 75cents or 50cents is normal. We were given a flyer for a place called Utopia who have a happy hour with 25cents beer. Stupidly cheap.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/04/13/day-183-tuesday-15th-march-phnom-penh-to-sihanoukville/","summary":"Our bus to Sihanoukville was booked for lunchtime so we thought we’d squeeze in some essential sight-seeing before we left Phnom Penh and visited the Royal Palace \u0026amp; Silver Pagoda first thing Tuesday morning.

It took 7 hours, less than we thought, and the journey went surprisingly fast.\nBy the time we’d settled into our hotel and ventured out it was dark so we couldn’t be bothered to explore too far for food. To Matt’s delight we found BB World. Nothing to do with Blackberry but Cambodia’s answer to McDonalds. Air-conditioned, free wifi, fake sugary mr whippy ice-cream. What more could you ask for when you’ve just landed in a big strange city after being out in the sticks?\nSaturday morning in daylight we were more relaxed about Phnom Penh. Visited the Psar Toul Tom Pong, also known as the Russian market, a large covered market place selling anything you can think of. I bought a genuine “Gap” vest top for $1.50 (many clothes factories are in Cambodia) and we purchased our first real souvenir – a teapot set. One of those cute little ones with a bamboo handle and six little cups the size of eggcups. We have no kitchen to put it in but I’m sure it’ll come in handy.\nContinuing our fast food fetish we tried out KFC. Its hot over here OK! They gave us food on real china plates. How posh is that? Could you see that happening in the UK?\nNext stop was the Tuol Sleng genocide museum. It was one of the most harrowing experiences. Before 1975 it was a school. From 1975 to 1979 it was a torture prison used by the Khmer Rouge. Photos were displayed of all who died there. And of some who worked there. Most were so young. It was shocking. Neither of us wanted to take any photos. Why would you? You go there to learn, to see for yourself what happened, to reflect. You’re not going to show your family photos of torture chambers, 2ft by 5ft prison cells and graves in a schoolyard. And its not something you yourself would want to look over again. But so many of the tourists there had their cameras out clicking away.\nTo change the subject and talk about food yet again Matt ordered frogs for dinner. They have tiny bones. Fiddlier than chicken wings. But tasty. Like chicken…\nSunday we took a wander to the Victory of Independence monument. Yet another huge archway in a capital city. Why did these become so trendy? It was built in 1958 and is meant to look similar to Angkor Wat architecture.\nMatt joined the Phnom Penh Hash House Harriers for their weekly Sunday afternoon run. Off he went at 14:30 in the back of a pick-up truck to the edge of the city to run 10k along the edge of the Killing Fields.\n Hi, Matt here, thought I’d just start typing some blog in the middle of Karen’s blog… I just turned up to meet the running club in the midday heat for a run. They were an interesting bunch with t-shirts saying things like “Dodging landmines since 1992”. A little worrying when Cambodia has an estimated 10 million active landmines lying around. A hash run is a strange orienteering style run where you have to run through fields and villages looking for little markers and trying not to get lost too much. The main purpose seems to be to run in the heat and get really thirsty so that you enjoy the beers more at the end. Excellent. Since I didn’t get seriously lost or blown up, I’ll hand it back to Karen…\n Whilst Matt was out running and getting lost in the mine-fields I went for a bit of a wander round the shops. Central Market is an odd one. Its a retro domed building with four “legs” containing a mishmash of stalls selling the usual clothes, bags, souvenirs or fish, with alleyways of manicurists and pedicurists and in contrast the centre dome is like a large jewellery department in Debenhams. Glass cabinets of sunglasses, necklaces, watches and sparkling crystals fill the floor.\nSomehow I didn’t buy a single thing. And Matt wasn’t even there to stop me from spending.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/04/13/day-179-to-182-friday-11th-to-monday-14th-march-phnom-penh/","summary":"I have been particularly slack on the blog writing front so am typing this a month after the event.

How many people can you get in a 13 seater minivan? Well if you attach a luggage rack to the back (boot open), pack everyone’s belongings onto it, tie all the extra random bags full of random stuff around it and pile 4 people on top, 4 adults on each row of seats, 2 adults in the passenger seat and an extra passenger in the driver’s seat plus as many kids as there are gaps…about 26 plus driver.\nAt this point a few people had been dropped off so the couple of guys left on the luggage had a little snooze.Could have been worse. I spotted a similar minivan, boot open, with 2 mopeds hanging off the backseats, a guy sat on each.\nIn the van we met Eva \u0026amp; Joke from Netherlands and Phillip from London. In Sen Monorom we all ended on the back of motos going to the same place 2km out of town called Nature Lodge (don’t believe the LP which says its 800m away).\nThere we met the manager, a lovely guy who was extra keen to learn English. Matt instantly became his teacher and the words he wanted to learn were fascinating as they came from either books over 50 years old or business magazines. Every spare moment he had when we were in close proximity to him was filled with explaining words or tenses. Matt really enjoyed it.\nAt Nature Lodge, relaxing on our hammock (we did use it again – it was worth lugging it all the way from India!) at our bungalow.The bungalow was similar to Tree Top Ecolodge yet the bathroom was even more open-air with no roof. You stepped out of the back of your bungalow into an outside “garden” with stepping stones to a shower (powered by gas cylinder), loo and sink surrounded by pot plants. It was lovely except for when the gale-force winds started up and you found the hot shower sprayed every direction except over you!\nThrough Nature Lodge and together with Eva, Joke \u0026amp; Philip, we booked a 2 night jungle trek. I was apprehensive about 3 days as usually after one night we’re ready to head back. But I was really pleased we did it.\nThe trek included a guide called Cham plus this little guy and his mahout (elephant trainer)He is Mouse, a working elephant, one of four in the village. 54 years old. Apparently elephants can live to 100 and they only sleep for 1hour a day. Never knew that.\nHe wasn’t there for riding. None of us wanted that kind of trek. We made sure he looked well and he just carried our supplies.\nAnytime he was hungry or tired we would stop and rest so he could wander off into the jungle on his own. Or one of the guides would go and chop down some bamboo to feed him and he would chomp away until he was ready to move on.\nWe trekked through the jungle along both wellworn pathways and through trees and undergrowth that had barely been touched. The elephant followed us and sometimes we wondered how he could get through. We’d had to climb over some fallen trees and the elephant did the same. Carefully stepping over each trunk with each leg. Once having one back leg between two trunks. So elegant.\nAt one point we thought we were lost. We stood in the middle of the jungle, trees all around and the elephant and mahout wandering around us. We’d been heading for a waterfall but had come to the edge of a cliff so the mission was to find the route down.\nEventually they found it and we were on some old overgrown vehicle tracks. It did make me wonder if these had been made recently or in the seventies during the war. They seemed to be in the middle of trees with no route either way. Made me nervous thinking about cluster bombs but we were with locals who knew the area inside out (?).\nWe reached a river and the elephant was tired so this was our camp for the night.”U.S. Army” hammocks with integrated mossie nets. The guides made food over a campfire and we sat on the ground at a makeshift table of an old wooden plank on top of water bottles.\nBy 7.30pm it was pitch black and we were all in our hammocks ready for bed. Can’t say I slept well that night. There were a lot of noises (especially ribbiting Cambodian frogs) and sounds of wood cracking around us. It was also surprisingly cold. Halfway through the night I needed the loo. There was no way I was getting out of that hammock alone and I couldn’t get Matt’s attention in the next hammock. He was out for the count. So I had to wait til sunrise.\nWhilst we had breakfast the mahout cooked the meat for lunch. It is ingenious how everything these guys do uses things from the forest. Two sticks with pieces of meat between them, bound with vine. Three or four of these were leant against each other over the fire to cook.\nAt breakfast Matt became creative and made a dream catcher. Mouse took a liking to it, or rather a disliking, as he headbutted it and tore it out of the ground. He probably thought it was food. It’s amazing to watch an elephant pull small trees from the ground, shake it to get the dirt off and then munch it down.\nBelow Cham is holding a Shikara. These little critters eat dead trees and they make such a racket. Especially at dawn and dusk, the whole jungle comes alive with this chanting and screeching. It can give you a headache!\nA couple of hours walking and we found our waterfall and lagoon and went for a swim. A well needed cooldown on such a hot day.\nWhilst sunbathing I felt an ant crawling on me. When i tried to brush him off he was still there and I realised he was dead. I’ve never seen anything like it. He was completely intact. Cham said it is a form of suicide. If they can’t kill their prey they kill themselves out of shame. This little guy had tried to bite me but managed to bite my good-luck band from Laos and killed himself because of it. Poor mite.This is where we were setting up camp so after lunch we went to look for Mouse in the jungle. Not sure who found who first…The view from the other camera…We left him alone and on the way back to camp our mahout had spotted a beehive ready for the taking. Well he thought it was. We thought it was madness. The biggest beehive we’ve seen at the top of this huge tree and he was planning on sending the younger guy up there to smoke it out and bring him the honey.\nHere the guy who drew the short straw is building a smoking branch. Bamboo branches bound together and stuffed with leaves.\nHe then wrapped his face with a scarf and set off up the tree. Halfway up he sets the branch of leaves smoking and carries on up to the beehive.\nAs we watched from the ground we could see the bees swarming from the hive. At that point we’d seen enough and walked swiftly back to camp leaving all of our guides waiting for the honey. We didn’t fancy meeting any angry bees.\nWe waited and waited and waited and…\n…show me the honey…\nThe short straw guy had done it. He’d climbed up the tree, smoked them darn bees out and brought home the reward in a large green bag – the whole hive.\nPouring the excess honey into the saucepanSqueezing the honey from the honeycombPan full of honeyCollecting it in bottles to take back to the villageThe short straw guy had sustained some injury. Mainly stings to his hands but he seemed to be happy enough. They get $10 per litre and this hive gave them 4.5 litres!\nAfter setting up the hammocks we joined the family around the campfire for grub and rice wine. Strong stuff although not too unpleasant. One guy had caught a fish from the river, skewered it and put it over the fire. He’d decided not to kill it beforehand though and we watched as this live kebab squirmed around being cooked. Talk about fresh food.\nSlept better that night. Being able to see the stars through the mossie mesh and hearing the waterfall made for a more pleasant experience. Plus I think we were all more used to the hammocks now.\nMorning bathtime for MouseMorning fishing for Cham – he managed to catch 2 little tiddlers which were promptly cooked and eaten by the mahoutsWe joined another group with their elephant as the mahouts are from the same family.\n  Our trek back took us through farmland where many fruits, herbs and spices were growing like pineapples, bananas, lemongrass, galangal, etc. Cham also pointed out a loofah tree. We had no idea these grew on trees. He picked one, peeled it and I now use it in the shower!\nA baby pineapple before its old enough to turn yellowElephants amid the pineapplesAnd we stopped for lunch at another waterfallOverall we enjoyed the trek. We loved the fact that its still not very well-trodden by tourists. You really felt like you were getting to see the real Cambodia with the local people. We were both shocked at how much land is being de-forested though.

There have been many different designs of tuk-tuk in Lao and this was our first sat aside a motorbike in a 2 person carriage that looks like it might from a ferris wheel. It was surprisingly fast and manoeuvred around other traffic in an agile fashion.\nThere was a sorng thaew there already filled with passengers, shopping bags of baguettes and rugs. We squeezed on the back whilst our backpacks joined the piled roof covered with chicken baskets and sacks of produce. It was 13:30 by then and we were peckish but with no luck finding a noodle joint we’d resigned ourselves to waiting til we got to Champasak. Then we had an idea to grab some sticky rice to keep us going. So Matt armed with our Phoom Chai g.h. pot had it topped up at a market stall. It’s a pretty good snack really. A little bland maybe without a tasty sauce for dipping but fills the gap.\nSurprisingly it only took an hour to get from Pakse to Champasak. They’re improving the roads so half of it was brand new tarmac. The other half we were pretty much off-roading along an old dusty track alongside the main road.\nThe guys on the sorng thaew couldn’t have been more helpful and dropped us off exactly where we wanted to be so it took us 2 mins to find a really good guest house Khampouy with free tea and Lao coffee plus help yourself fridge of drinks and pay when you leave. Needless to say we sampled 4 bottles of Beerlao and completely cleaned them out that night.\nWhilst sat on our verandah with one of the said Beerlao the sky was so clear you could see many stars and suddenly the brightest shooting star we’ve ever seen flashed overhead. What a sight. We waited for more but that seemed to be the only one. We’d just witnessed a near-miss extinction of planet Earth. (Slight exaggeration ;) but it was a good-sized flash of light!)\nAnd no we weren’t so drunk that we imagined it. Just merry :)\n Still Sunday we both were a bit hanging but we made ourselves get a moped and go to visit one of the “most important archaeological sites in Laos” -LP. Wat Phu Champasak. There is not a lot of it left and it is crumbling further due to water saturation however the setting was fantastic. There are 3 levels. The first are two reservoirs with a central walkway which continues past 2 large Khmer style buildings. Then steep steps take you up to the next level with a Buddha protecting the gate. Another set of even steeper disrupted steps with gnarled Frangipani trees either side look like something out of a Tim Burton film and at the top there is the “sanctuary” another very old building plus three rocks with an elephant, a crocodile and Buddha’s foot sculpted into them. From this level you can see for miles and miles and miles across Laos. It was so peaceful there. And the hoards of crowds which the LP warned of never appeared. For anyone visiting Champasak just be aware there is hardly anywhere to eat a meal near the guesthouses. We tried to find somewhere different each meal and always ended up in the restaurant opposite Khampouy guest house which did lovely food although they only ever had chicken.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/04/03/day-166-167-saturday-26th-to-sunday-27th-february-champasak-wat-phu-champasak/","summary":"After a nice lie-in, the first in a while, a good banana pancake for brekkie from the local Indian, also a first in a while, and an excellent cup of coffee we jumped in a “remork-moto” to the new market (Talat Dao Heung) bus station.

Out of this world is one way to describe them.\nTree Top Explorer is a new venture run by Green Discovery that has only been running 2 months.\nOur trek begins 90mins outside of Pakse at a village south of Paksong in the heart of the Bolaven Plateau famous for its coffee. We stop at a house with a woman roasting coffee beans in a wok over a low fire and where thousands of coffee beans are drying in the backyard.\nCollect our full body harness, helmet and “braking stick” and we’re on our way. There are about 12 tourists and 5 guides at this point.\nBefore reaching the coffee plantations where we see men picking the coffee beans we stop to look at more coffee beans drying in the sun and hear how the different types (skin on/off) can mean a difference between the quality and therefore the price they can sell – between 20,000kip per kg and 35,0000 kip per kilogram. In current exchange rates that’s £1.65 to £3 per kg.\nThe trekking continues past the coffee trees and into the jungle and maybe an hour later we have our first use of our harness. The swing bridge. Both scary and beautiful we wobbled across the bridge which traverses a waterfall and this is where we sit for lunch. As it’s the dry season there is not so much water so we’re able to sit on the rocks with water around us as we eat our traditional Lao lunch of sticky rice, dried meats and fish, veg and chilli tomato sauce.\nMore trekking and we arrive at our first zip line. A mini one to get us used to trusting the contraption wrapped around our body.\nAnd then we’re off. Zip line after zip line. With some lowering on rope through platforms to zip lines below. Somehow are at the top of an amazing valley blanketed with jungle and waterfalls and invisible wires until you get up close that take you on exhilarating rides across the front of waterfalls.\nThe more we did the more confident Matt became and started bouncing off the platforms to start flying through the air. Me I’m always a bit more of a scaredy-cat. The final one they were all shouting jump jump as the wire changes height suddenly as it takes your weight. I ran to the edge with full intentions to jump and my annoying sensible brain kicked in and stopped and sat down, feet dangling over the edge and I slid off the end! At the other end the guide was shouting “brake, brake, BRAAAKE!” but although I was putting all my strength into pulling down the branch on the line nothing happened and I ended up knee-capping him as he protected me from hitting the tree.A little more hardened trekking and by 4pm we arrive at our lodgings for the night completely camouflaged by the jungle we hadn’t noticed the village until we were practically on top of it.\nAnd what a setting. I cannot describe well enough the sheer magnitude of the waterfall which was the backdrop to the lodge. Again it wasn’t as large as it would be in the rainy season but for us it was the largest waterfall we have ever seen. Utterly stunning.\nYou know how after being somewhere for a few hours with nice scenery you get used to it and it becomes oh yeah there it is again that’s nice. This was different. You can’t get used to it. Dinner, breakfast and lunch were served with this magnificent backdrop and every time we looked up at it our jaws dropped and we felt like it was a dream.\nAnother long-time dream of mine was fulfilled that day. A waterfall shower. Again I can’t describe it well enough and now it feels like another dream. Standing on the huge rocks under the pure fresh (brrr cold) water looking up at the mountain behind was completely unreal to us. How many journeys we have been on this trip and how many things we have experienced we keep thinking that we could experience anything better still. But this beat everything else. Well almost on a par with Sandakphu and seeing the Himalayan skyline.\nA group of four from Thailand joined us later for dinner and they turned out to be from the Thailand National Geographic who are writing a piece on green adventures. So we may get to be in a proper publication. You never know.\nOur tree house (on the left)True air-conditioned accommodation – all night you could hear the waterfalls The only entrance to our treehouse – great fun in pitch black :) Tuesday morning Matt \u0026amp; I opted for another open-air waterfall shower and this time no-one else was around so it really felt unreal. Just us 2 stood under the waterfall in the middle of the jungle.\nToday we had two long zip lines which lasted a minute each. Wow! As we each did the second one the guy from National Geographic came across the first zip line in tandem with a guide in order to film us going across.\nJust about to start the first 400m zipline… (that’s my “I’m excited really I am and not at all scared” face)\nMatt filmed me doing the 2nd one – here’s the link to YouTube:\n  And Matt filmed himself on the zipline but unfortunately its too big to upload at the moment so will be coming to a YouTube near you soon…and here it is\n  Final activity of the trek was the Via Ferrata:\nHere I am at the beginning of the Via Ferrata about 1min before I freaked out because I remembered I didn’t like heights, dropped my camera case into a tree which had to be recovered by one of the guides and then be taken up to the top by another guide. It was silly really. After the initial bit I’d got over it and realised how stupid I was but the guides were really good and took me up all the way to make sure I was safe.\nMatt needless to say loved every minute of this as much as he’d loved the zip lines. And I couldn’t believe I let if affect me that way as I’d been fine leaping off ravines a couple of hours before!\nThe climb up was worth every drop of sweat as we reached the top of the waterfall we’d once been at the bottom of. We could see the rest of the group at the lodge waving to us.\nA bit more perspiring took us upwards some more and onto level ground through the coffee plantations. The last 5 mins we hitched a ride in the back of the truck.

This was the busiest bus we’ve been on so far in Laos. Only 1 mile after starting out there were more people than seats so the plastic stools once again came out and by the time we arrived in Pakse 5 hours later the aisle was full of people sitting on stools (or the floor and leaning on stools trying to sleep) with at least 4 people standing at the front. We were one of the lucky ones. We had pretty comfy seats and an open window so managed to stay cool enough.\nWhen buses stop it’s normal for women to come to the windows with food and drink for sale. When we stopped for a 10 min loo break it took 9 mins to get off as they all decided to pile on the bus. If you can imagine the amount of people already on this bus and me and a few others trying to get off the bus to find a loo and the aisle filled with plastic stools and women waving meat and eggs on sticks around it was like a Carry On film (again).\nHad our first, and we hope only, experience of blatant tourist extortion in Laos today. At Pakse bus station a guy asked if we wanted a tuk tuk. Yes OK how much. 20,000 kip each. Oh that’s good we thought to go 7km to town. Got onto this empty jumbo tuk tuk and then every single tourist on that bus were piled onto the same tuk tuk. Including two sitting in the front with the driver both holding on for dear life. There were 15 of us and they still expected everyone to pay 20,000 kip each. 300,000 kip is about £25. In my experience that’s a bloody expensive taxi by UK standards. It wouldn’t have been quite so bad (although our 5 hour bus journey was only 40,000 kip each) but then the driver stopped about 1km from the town and demanded we pay up before he took us any further. Of course 15 of us to 1 of him was no match and half of the tuk tuk said they’d been quoted 10,000. So he rings his boss and starts to turn the tuk tuk around. We start shouting at him to stop as we were happy to get out and walk the rest of the way rather than go back to the bloody bus station. In the end he compromised and charged us 15,000 each. None of us could believe that this was happening in Laos. I really hope that’s not a sign of things to come because this country is such a beautiful place and it doesn’t need to overcharge tourists and start putting them off coming here. We’re happy to pay a fair price.\nAnywho, Pakse seems quite soul-less and our hotel is similar but adequate. Found Green Discovery to ask about their Tree Top Explorer trip and it seemed we couldn’t go until Friday so we thought about going somewhere else for a couple of days first. But 10 mins before they shut we went back to check the prices and found that there were two spaces left on the trip for tomorrow so we booked it! $187 each as there are two full groups of 8.

The Japanese had drilled for oil and instead found salt water which is pumped out of the ground and either dried in the sun for 2 to 3 days or boiled in big vats. Either way it’s manually scraped and shovelled into baskets by 40 Lao families who work there. The salt is then sent to local areas or Vietnam. It was unbelievable how manual the work is. Things which in the UK we’d automatically think a machine would do but this is providing work for local people.\nPasert our ECO guide on a pile of salt (pretending it’s snow):Sun-drying the saltBoiling the salt water:Kids playing at the salt factoryThe trek began with meeting a local guide at the roadside and then diving straight into the forest. He was there to explain the multitude of plants, trees and creatures which had a variety of uses for the local people.\nWe drank water from some chopped branches, tried fresh cardomon, different fruits – some looked like dung, others like cherries, some sweet and some sharp, leaves that tasted like sour apple which are eaten to wake you up, other leaves that helped bad stomachs, others that helped with dizziness. An ant that when crushed made you dizzy from the smell and the same ant would act as an anti-venom if a snake bit you.\nHe showed us a tree which they collect glue from and another tree which when burned releases an oil which is used for burning torches. The locals set fire to the trunk and after 10mins put out the fire with a bundle of branches. The tree then releases the oil. They come back every 5 days to collect the oil.\nNatural tree oilHoney is collected from these super-high trees. Wooden pegs are driven into the bark by 3 knocks only. The guy will then climb up the pegs and hammer in more as he goes until he gets to the top. No harness is used. They don’t fall because they receive agreement from the tree spirit that they can go up for honey beforehand and they are protected from falling by this spirit.\n Inspiring environmental signs were all over the forest. I particularly liked this one:Lunch was a feast. Served sat next to Nam Thong lake (?). Liver, pork, fish, boiled eggs, small eggplants, bamboo concoction wrapped in banana leaf, green beans, stem broccoli, sticky rice, bananas, rice cakes covered with locally grown sugar palm caramel and corn in coconut milk \u0026amp; rice.\nOn reaching the local village we passed the fishing lake filled with men and women with mini chinese nets dipping in and out of the water. Pasert showed us a bamboo cage which had three fish trapped inside, one a catfish.\nOur bed for the night – Mr Nhang’s HomestayOur hostess Mrs Nhang who fed us warm sweet sticky rice with banana and beans wrapped in banana leaf as soon as we arrived.\nThe oldest stupa in Laos (over 2000 years old) is situated in the grounds of the local templeVillagers making torches. There’s a conveyor belt of people doing different things. Some women were pinning leaves together of similar size. Some were making the wood chippings for burning. Some were mixing the wood chippings with the oil from the trees and boiling it to help absorb it and make it less sticky. These girls were filling the leaves with the oily chippings and stringing them shut. One of them seemed to be particularly interested to know if Paul, the other tourist with us, was married.Pasert asked us if we wanted to see where a woman gives birth. Not the usual kind of thing you expect to hear or think about seeing but he took us around the corner to meet a 4-day old baby and her mother. They were sat on a platform outside their home, with fire burning underneath to keep them warm. Two pots of water and herbs boiled next to the platform, One for eating, one for bathing. It is tradition for a mother and new born baby to stay here for 7 to 11 days after birth. Some go to hospital to have their baby and then come home to do this. Others, as this girl did, give birth here.\nCheeky kids visiting the new babyBaci ceremony\nIn traditional Lao culture every new guest is welcomed into a home by a baci ceremony. So much preparation had gone into this and it was definitely not put on for tourists. There was a shrine of woven leaves with coconut sticks covered in white cotton strands and yellow chrysanthemums in the middle of the table surrounded by food. We were each given a plate with a banana, boiled egg, some sticky rice and a sweet banana leaf as an offering which we had to eat at some point during the evening. Then each member of the family and some of the neighbours too took some cotton tied a knot in the centre and then tied it around our wrists as we held our plate of food out and as they gave us a blessing in Lao to good health, good fortune and good luck for the future. We also had a couple of “good marriage” comments too from the older ladies! These cannot be removed for 3 days and after that cannot be cut. We felt extremely privileged to be part of this ceremony.\nThen food was served and we each had a shot of Lao-Lao whiskey passed around in the same glass for good luck. It smells terrible like Tequila but is much smoother. Though I could only take 1 shot, Matt went for 2 :)\nThis is Matt after drinking Lao-Lao :)\nAlms-giving ceremony\nWe took part in the daily alms-giving ceremony to the monks early the next day. Mrs Nhang kindly lent me a skirt to make me a bit more presentable. We had bowls of snacks and a pot of sticky rice and we kneeled in the street as the monks came past and we placed balls of sticky rice and a snack into their bowls. It was over so quickly it hardly seemed real. Just a flash of orange.\nThis is just after at 6.45am which is why I have massive bags:After a lush breakfast we were on our way again for a morning trek across rice fields…\n…to another village Ban Phon Sim where there was more creative work going on.\nGirls weaving rattan mats.

They make 2 a day and sell them for 20,000kip each (£1.65).\nA guy making thatched roofing.Making rice noodles. The rice is pounded into a gloopy paste and poured into this wooden “sieve”. Another block is pushed down like a large garlic press and the noodles stream into the boiling pot below. 5 seconds later they’re scooped out into cold water and rinsed and then hand-scooped out into a large bowl ready for eating. They tasted extremely bland without the soup and seasoning.\nMats hanging out to dryVillage living with cow \u0026amp; buffalo carts parked underneath and chickens everywhere.More trekking followed in the heat until more food at another lake and a beer stop at Lake Bvanga on the way back.

There’s not much here but every guesthouse was full on Friday evening. After trying 4 different guesthouses we ended up in the dodgy Khammouane Inter Guest House next door to the Karaoke, with a single bed masquerading as a double bed. I use the word bed in the loosest of terms as the mattress was rock hard and sunken in the middle. There were no curtains on the rails and the wooden shutters were covered by torn mossie nets. It had aircon though. A massive archaic machine was fitted on the ceiling directly above the “bed” which threatened to fall on us in the night. And it had a teeny “SONY” TV and a teeny fridge which were both as old as the hotel. I would say in its heyday it would have been a swanky modern business hotel. But 30 years on without any money spent on it during that time it had become more than a little tired and was overpriced.\nNeedless to say we hardly slept that night. It wasn’t helped by me feeling ill. We’d had grilled fish on a stick with sticky rice from a street stall for dinner which tasted lovely but later wasn’t so lovely.\nOnce again we moved guesthouses. A 15 min sweaty walk to the tourist information and we stumbled across Douxan Guest House which had a proper size bed and was more of a home than a hotel. This meant a 15-min extremely sweaty walk with our backpacks from the previous hotel. We were hard and managed it without either of us complaining which makes a change ;)\nWe intended to take a trip to Kong Lor Cave but for a 1 day tour they wanted to charge us £120. Ridiculous prices. It may have been cheaper if more people wanted to go but we couldn’t justify it and so we’ve canned Tha Khaek and leave tomorrow.\nDespite not doing much in Tha Khaek we did find a hidden gem on Saturday night. Whilst sitting at another Mekong riverside restaurant watching another beautiful sunset over Thailand (where tourists jump on boats and come across the Mekong to gawp at Laos and then go back again) we spotted a bar on the river with neon lights. This was the Smile bar which opens at 9pm and after a precarious hike down steep steps to the river you enter a place with the feel of the Thekla in Bristol. A bit dingy and badly laid out but good live music, packed with people and a great atmosphere. With fairy lights thrown in for good measure. I learned how to dance Lao-style that evening by a very drunk Lao guy and some pretty tipsy Lao girls.\nAnother sunset over Thailand","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/03/04/day-158-to-159-friday-18th-to-saturday-19th-february-tha-khaek/","summary":"Tha Khaek is a funny one.

Very Parisian with their little wicker baskets on the front.\nWent back to the Immigration Office to renew our passports. It takes 24hours so we’re in Vientiane for a couple more days.\nMost temples and museums are shut between 12:00 \u0026amp; 13:00 so we sat under the Patuxai (Arc de Triomphe) with a beer \u0026amp; a water to shade from the midday sun. Monday \u0026amp; Tuesday were overcast. Today it’s blue skies all the way \u0026amp; it’s a scorcher.\nTook our bikes the 2km ride up the Th. That Luang to the Pha That Luang, the most important national monument in Laos. The LP says it’s a symbol of both the Buddhist religion and Lao sovereignty. It is a beautiful structure. All golden against the blue backdrop. Surrounding it are a number of gorgeous temples, some new, some old. The newer ones now have gold spray paint adorning the ceilings and pillars whereas it used to be gold leaf. (In the Wat Phu in Thailand they were still using gold leaf). All sponsored by Walls, Lux and Persil…\nWith lucky birds in cages to purchase and release for good fortune…And unusual paintings and sculpturesHad local’s noodle soup for lunch. Extra chilli, lots of coriander \u0026amp; random things you can’t recognise. Delicious and a bargain at a quid a soup.\nWhilst cycling to the COPE centre we spotted a barber’s shop and as Matt’s mop was evolving a life of its own he got it all chopped off. We both looked a little worried when the guy got the razor out straightaway and used it on dry hair but it turns out he knew what he was doing (even though he had TWO Westlife posters on the wall) and Matt’s £1.60 hairdo is as good as when we left in September.\nWith hair…Still with hair…With a lot less hair… (note the poster)COPE is a centre for people needing prosthetic limbs usually due to them being blown off by a cluster bomb left over by America’s secret war in Laos which happened simultaneously to the Vietnam war but never seems to be mentioned. I’d been to the UXO centre in Luang Prabang which explained what cluster bombs were and how many there are left lying around but it didn’t really hit home how many people are affected by them until seeing the COPE exhibition. They can look like toys so many children play with them and the consequences are unimaginable. We watched a video where victims and/or their families were interviewed about the effect they’d had. And it wasn’t just in this part of the world. There have been 30 countries across the world where cluster bombs have been used and the leftovers are continually maiming or killing people. It was harrowing to watch and a real eye-opener. How many things we in the UK and I assume most Western countries are completely oblivious to. How much crap we are fed about wars and how much is hidden from us. We think we’re too clever to be taken in by propaganda but so much I have seen in the past 5 months has made me realise that I’m just as guilty believing things we are told or not told in our country. I could go on and on about this but I wouldn’t do it justice. Please have a look at the website www.copelaos.org.\nAs Vientiane is a capital city of course it has a bowling alley. Possibly the only one in the whole of Laos. It was like stepping back in time to when you didn’t need a complicated computer system to calculate scores. A basic black and white screen with 10 boxes by 6 boxes were all you needed and your name couldn’t be more than 3 characters long.\nWith a Beerlao in hand we played the first game and I was trailing all along and when I managed to get a strike Matt only went and got one straight after. But with his last game played he was on 97 and I was on 84. It wasn’t possible to beat him, or was it? I got an 8 then a spare. Whoop I could do it. All the pressure was on my third and final ball. Whoosh it rolled down the lane and completely cock-eyed I scored 3. Nooooo what a crap bowl. The black and white screen kept us in suspense (for at least a second) and there it was a DRAW!! Hooray! A certain person wasn’t impressed but I was ecstatic!\nOpted for a second game as two plates piled high with noodles turned up. They put a table and 2 chairs by the lanes and there we sat eating our dinner inbetween playing a game of ten pin bowling. Another surreal experience. It did everything for Matt’s game and nothing for mine as I deteriorated rapidly into scoring 1s and 2s all over the place. Disaster. Matt won respectably and I with my last mouthful of noodles was punished even more as the hottest chilli I have ever tasted hit the back of my throat and burned like a hot poker until it went numb!\nProof Matt won the next game\nIt was only 21:15 when we left the bowling alley so we headed to the night market along the main coastal road Fa Ngum. It was similar to Luang Prabang with lots of beautiful things but on a smaller, less cramped scale and I bought a pretty woven makeup bag for £2.\nStill didn’t feel like going back and ended up with a pitcher of Beerlao in a rooftop bar overlooking the Mekong (except for the fact that it was dark so no river in sight). The bar was packed and once again our memories of Phuket \u0026amp; Chiang Rai were resurrected as the number of young girls hanging out with older European men was above average for it to be true love. I guess because we’re in a capital city and it’s so close to Thailand it’s going to attract that kind of business. Luckily we haven’t seen it anywhere else in Laos. And it’s meant to be illegal for a Lao person to have sex with a non-Lao person before marriage. I guess laws never stop everyone. ","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/03/04/day-156-wednesday-16th-february-vientiane-pha-that-luang-cope-centre-bowling-matt-gets-a-haircut/","summary":"Hired bikes from the Youth Inn.

Delicious but again a little slow to arrive which meant we didn’t start tubing til 12:15.\n The weather had changed today so it was overcast and wasn’t as warm as last week. Actually the water was freezing. But on we went. We managed to avoid all the missiles being thrown at us and didn’t visit any bars until Bob Marley bar about 90 mins down the river (which isn’t far as most of it is completely still and you have to paddle yourself) and bumped into Edo and Annalies again.\nThe views around there are wonderful. It’s on a bend and as you float down the river the limestone karsts in the background seem to grow bigger and bigger the further away you get.\n2km before the end there’s a guy shouting Tuk-Tuk and a kayaker going by saying if I were you i’d get the tuk-tuk as it’s ages yet. It was only 3pm so we didn’t want to give up and persevered. Passingkids on rope swings, kids shouting beerlao, fishermen diving below the water, women and girls picking riverweed with their bamboo hats, motor boats came whizzing past and grey and pink water buffalo immersed in the river up to their noses chewing away.\nKids on a rope swing: Most of the river was calm but in places there were shallow rapids which you could hear before you were close enough to see them We’d hold hands down the rapids and sometimes collide into rocks or hit the ground. One dip caused a huge wave to come straight over me. It was bloomin freezing and Matt thought that was particularly hilarious.\nThen we could hear booming music in the distance and realised that the sun was still shining and we weren’t that far from Vang Vieng. Turning the corner we spotted the island bars and stopped off at Brownie bar where there were 3 menus – food, drink, drugs. They’re everywhere here, offered so openly even though it’s illegal.\nEven though it was freezing we popped back into the water to finish the last stretch. For some reason some local kids thought it would be entertaining to run along the bank and throw someone’s soggy pants at us. I bet they love tubers. They’re easy targets! :)\u0026amp; Despite the last minute attack, we made it back to the tubing place by 5pm.

Had the same class at the primary school again. This time Mikael another volunteer came and helped me.\nTuesday evening I taught Level 1-1 again on my own this time. Which was fine for a while but soon became rowdy. I played a running game with them where they had to draw pictures on the board and write the word I was saying like Cat, Hat, Fan, etc. Davone came to help out with calming them down in Lao and taught the word for quiet – Miet!. It was very entertaining watching them draw with their classmates in their team shouting at them. Absolute carnage but good fun.\nFrom 6 til 7 was Level 2-2 (14-16 plus 1 10-year old) and I was completely unprepared for it. Only 6 students and had 2 guys taking the piss the whole time. It was hard to make “that is a chair, those are chairs, those are four chairs” an interesting lesson.\nAs the power was off all over Vang Vieng again including the farm, Matt couldn’t spend all day on stolencamerafinder again so he went for his first run in 5 months. He was half-dead when I got back! Really must do more.\nWednesday\nSame kids again in the morning where we learned the letter M. Much easier than L. I got my camera out 5 mins before the end and they went loopy. They wouldn’t stay still so as well as taking a few pics I had to do a small video to be able to see them properly. It’s the cutest thing as they’re waving and saying Sabaidee but can’t put it on this blog at the moment.\nEvening time I taught Level 1-2 this time and then Level 2. A hot air balloon almost came down across the road during the Level 1 class so they were more interested in that. Level 2 I was better prepared and there more students (10) who weren’t being smart arses.\nWhilst I was at school Matt went out taking photos of Vang Vieng and captured a pic of the same hot air balloon which we’d seen in class.\nThursday\nHad the best Level 2 class yet. I’d made up a wordsearch which seemed to entertain them and another temp volunteer, Gijs helped. He also took some pics of me teaching. And when I said it was my last day one of the girls came up to me and said I was a very good teacher. Ahhhh.\nLevel1 kids:\nLevel 2 kids:\nFriday\nNo teaching later so no prep needed. We used the moped to go to Blue Lagoon. 7km away from Vang Vieng through stunning scenery again and the blue lagoon was idyllic. Although I managed to get a “Thailand tattoo” as I burned a mark on my leg from the exhaust pipe. Luckily we were at the lagoon so I could go and jump straight in to cool it down.\nFish in the lagoon Stopped at the local community project on the way back to ask about the weaving. Really enthusiastic guy who turned out to be at the school meeting that evening and is linked to the EEFA. He’s trying to set up teaching in Nathong village, help locals start up weaving by paying for looms, create bio-gas from manure to fuel homes rather than them using wood and initiate trekking into the hills and overnight camping to help fund this. Currently building a community centre.\n[ Update 03/10/2011: Sengkeo (Bob) has kindly sent the correct website for this inspirational project: http://www.saelaoproject.com ]\nTo get to the lagoon you either have to pay to go over the toll bridge or you can go over the footbridge for free. Here’s Matt skilfully not crashing the moped into the river:The school meeting was very official. All the members of the executive board and the teachers were there.

The little girl is so cute. She can hardly be 1 year old and likes teetering around in her mum’s high heels.Hired the same moped again for 5 days.

Lots of volunteers turned up to do temporary teaching this time plus Ben who had taught 2 weeks previously.\nI had my primary school class with two volunteers. Yvette \u0026amp; Nadja.

All the evening classes are now back to normal so I ended up teaching level 1s (ages 7 to 10) their ABCs with one of the Level 3 students. There weren’t enough classrooms so we sat in a circle outside on the grass.\nAs there were a number of volunteers, I was able to leave earlier and was back by 18:30. Matt was nowhere to be seen. He was out scurrying around doing last minute birthday things. I cried when I saw what it was. He’d got everyone to email me personal messages saying Happy Birthday. It felt a little Big Brother like and I realised again how much I miss home and everyone. It was the best present. So thoughtful.\nPlus the biggest chocolate muffin I’d ever seen as a birthday cake.\nLater we went out for dinner at Elephant Crossing, a restaurant built over the river. And we had the most delicious bottle of red wine with our dinner. I may have said in previous blogs but it’s something we really miss. Wine is usually too expensive here and Beerlao is 80p for 660ml so guess which always wins. It was a real treat.\nTo follow our dinner we headed back and stuffed our faces with chocolate chip muffin. Mmmmm perfect end to a birthday :)\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/02/20/day-147-monday-7th-february-vang-vieng-karens-33rd-birthday/","summary":"It’s my birthday and my nan’s. Happy Birthday Nan!!\nEarly brekkie at the most basic cafe you can imagine with a lovely little family running it. We’d been here a couple of times before as the views are fantastic. The little girl is so cute. She can hardly be 1 year old and likes teetering around in her mum’s high heels.Hired the same moped again for 5 days. I am becoming a pro now :) And headed off to the farm for the 9am meeting.","title":"Day 147 – Monday 7th February – Vang Vieng – Karen’s 33rd birthday"},{"content":"Today changed our opinion of Vang Vieng. We saw a different side to it.\nNo teaching so we had the whole day to ourselves. After a good-lie in and a chilled out brekkie lounging on raised platforms overlooking the Nam Song river and the karsts beyond, we took the moped for a drive across the countryside. And I mean across it. There aren’t many roads the other side of the river and to get to many of the “sightseeing” places such as caves and viewpoints you need to go across farmland, dodging chickens and cows and rocks and streams.\nThe first stop was a cave that a young boy on his bicycle guided us to through woodland and across fields (yes he was cycling as fast as us) to a cave where another young lad was sitting asking for 10k each to go in the cave. We were looking for a lagoon so we turned back and found our way across more random land (with some hiccups where we almost toppled) to a small shelter next to some pools of water and a fantastic backdrop of cliffs. The pools were not for swimming but we paid our 10k there and were guided to another pool with a step ladder for climbing up and jumping off. It didn’t look the clearest water we’d seen so put it off til after the caves.\nWell the first cave was beautiful but gave me the jitters. I’m not good with small confined spaces and the further we went in the more I wanted to leave. The crux was when the boy said “look spider!”. We shone our torches above our heads and sure enough this 8-legged monster was sat perched on a stalactite. OK it may not have been a tarantula but it was near enough. The boy said photo? No thanks where’s the exit? As we made our way through smaller gaps he kindly pointed out another spider to Matt. That was it I wasn’t even looking at that one, I was getting out of there pretty pronto.\nWe didn’t bother with the 2nd cave but the 3rd one had the promised lagoon inside. Hmmm. It was extremely pokey. I saw as much as I wanted to see and let matt carry on down to the “lagoon”. It was a tiny, perfectly still, ice cold pool of crystal clear water. With one fish in it.\nClimbed up to viewpoint with panoramic views over Vang Vieng. I say climbed because it was literally scaling limestones rocks and bamboo ladders in flip flops.\nAs my birthday is Monday and I am teaching we adopted Saturday 5th February as Karen’s drinking birthday. This involved going “Tubing”. Described as a relaxing trip 4km down the Nam Song river on an inner tube quickly turns into a complete mess if you’re not careful. Which of course we weren’t.\nA tuk tuk drops you off up river from Vang Vieng (not far from The Organic Farm) and you walk 10 mins up river (to pretty much the Organic Farm) to the start of the bars that are packed along the side of the river.\nWe stopped at Fluid bar to grab a beer for the walk up to the tubing start. Beerlao in one hand, tube in the other we followed a narrow footpath avoiding cows as we went.\nThe first bar was packed and had the obligatory swing over the river. Which we both did in order to get the getting wet over and done with in one go.\nAfter tootling down the river about 100m we were then towed in by another bar. They throw plastic bottles on the end of ropes to catch you.\n3rd bar was a whiskey bucket bar. Matt did another swing into the river.\nThings started going downhill from here. It was about 4pm by now and someone said there was no way we’d get down the river before dark so just had to do a couple more bars nearby which included fluorescent body paint and get a tuk tuk back. Needless to say we didn’t get our tubes back to town.\nThe rest of the evening is a bit of a blur. We definitely had boiling hot pizza as my mouth burned for days after and we went to a club. Basically encouraging the hedonistic side of Vang Vieng. I am such a hypocrite.\nHad nightmare hangovers on Sunday and so spent most of the day watching Family Guy in one of the tacky TV bars!\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/02/20/day-144-to-146-friday-4th-to-sunday-6th-february-vang-vieng-karens-birthday-weekend-caves-tubing/","summary":"Today changed our opinion of Vang Vieng.

EEFA stands for Equal Education For All and is based at the Organic Farm 4km from Vang Vieng in Phoudindeng. I signed up for 2 weeks of volunteering as an English teacher. A chance to use the TEFL skills and to give something back.\nMonday morning I was scared to death. I had no real experience of teaching or of working with kids whatsover. They were going to eat me alive.\nGrabbed a pricey tuk-tuk (40,000kip) in Vang Vieng to go the 4km to the Organic Farm in ****Phou Dindeng for the 9am meeting. Met Amandine another volunteer whom had been at the farm for 2 days last November and was starting 3 weeks of volunteering. There’s some re-organisation going on at the moment so Davone the co-ordinator gave a brief overview of what lessons we would be teaching and Mark the long-term volunteer gave a little bit more info. We had to teach from 10:30 til 11:25 Monday to Wednesday and from 17:00 to 19:00 Monday to Thursday. With that, we had 20 mins to prepare a lesson on transportation and off we rode on borrowed bicycles to the local primary school 1km away.\nBoth Amandine and I had assumed we had one class between us. Turns out we had a class each. Twenty-five 11 \u0026amp; 12 year olds all ready to learn more English. Scary stuff.\nThere was a lot of noise coming from the classroom but as soon as I walked in they all ran to their seats and altogether said “Sabaidee”.\nThe classroom was quite basic with wooden desks and low thin benches and two blackboards, one usable, one not in such good condition. No glass windows. Just blue shutters which when open wide lit up the room with the strong sunshine. And the room itself was decorated with work by the students from floor to ceiling that gave the room life.\nActually the kids gave it more life than was possibly necessary.\nThe lesson went better than I expected. They were learning the present continuous linked with transportation. I am driving a car. She is driving the bus. He is pedalling (?) a bicycle. I am paddling a boat. He is flying a plane. Etc, etc… Lots of flashcards and charades. Me “flying” with arms outstretched around the room making neeeooowww noises. Or brmmmm brmmm with a pretend steering wheel. It’s quite difficult to mime pedalling a bike though.\nThe thing with young kids learning English is they tend to imitate exactly what you say so I had hide my giggles when the whole class said “I am driving my caaaaarrrr” in a blatantly forester accent! It worked well until just after 11 and they started getting restless, so we split into 2 teams and played hangman. Most of them got the “hang” of it in that they knew they should use words learned in the lesson. One boy though had a 4-letter word which the rest guessed began with B. Yes! Then O? Yes! Ah it’s boat they shout, A and T! Yes I agree as the boy smiles and writes O and K. Book he says and sits down. Umm yes that’s right.\nAt 11:25 the bell for end of school rang out and the kids poured out. A few stayed and closed all the shutters and gave me back the flashcards.\nI breathed a sigh of relief. The first lesson was done with and actually it wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. The kids were great. They just need more variety and more games to keep them occupied.\nMr T. let me borrow a bike to cycle back to Vang Vieng after the lesson. They’re not mountain bikes and 4km in the midday heat and back again. You can imagine I definitely lost weight today.\nMonday evening was completely different. It was a different school a bit further away and Amandine and I had to teach together. This week is exams for everyone else so only the Level 3s are around (ages 15/16/17+). And today only two students turned up. So we taught prepositions to Khamdee and Khamkeo for the first hour and for the second hour chatted about their lives and ours. Their English is really good. They just need to improve grammar and different tenses. It worked well too as we both helped each other out. It was good to have support.\nHad a dodgy cycle back to the farm in the dark. We had no lights and Amandine hit a curb and her chain fell off the bike. Luckily Khamdee \u0026amp; Khamkeo were experts and abandoned their own bikes in the middle of a pitch black road to come back and help. (None of the kids have lights). I thought to myself how I would have no idea how to fix a chain. (How ironic this becomes…)\nI then had to get a tuk-tuk back to Vang Vieng. Another 40,000kip. Can’t afford that everyday and not sure I can cycle 8km during the day so will have to get a moped.\n Tuesday was a repeat of yesterday but with different kids in the morning. Slightly younger at 8 and 9 I think. So they got bored of transportation a lot sooner. Though we played more games this time and at the end I got high-5s from the boys and hugs from the girls. I even got a fruit from one girl. They were so sweet!\nRegarding my own transportation I tried to get a moped before the morning class but failed miserably as most places only had semi-automatics and I had never driven a moped in my life before. So panicking because I was going to be late I hired an even dodgier bicycle and cycled as fast as I could to the farm only to hit some bumps 1km in and the chain shot off and got jammed in the frame. Shit. Here, on the side of a dusty road, outside Vang Vieng bus station, at the age of 32, is where I learned to fix a chain on a bicycle. And get covered in oil in the process :)\nThe bloody bike lost it’s chain again on the way between the farm and the school so I begrudgingly cycled the piece of junk straight back to the shop after the lesson and exchanged it for a semi-automatic moped. I had to learn that afternoon how to ride one on an abandoned CIA airstrip. Tuesday was turning out to be a day of lessons for me that I should have learned years ago.\nWednesday I taught at the same school as the evening class and Amandine went to the first school where we both had younger kids again. This time I had to teach the letter L. My favourite letter. Those who know me pretty well will know I have a strange accent for words with “L” in. So trying to teach Lao kids L was entertaining as I heard them repeat after me in a Karen-forester way “aaaalllll”. Luckily all the words began with L rather than ended in L so we had fun learning about Lions, Legs and Lemons and playing silly games.\nManaged to get a good deal on a moped for a few days so I’m no longer getting any exercise again.\nMy moped:Thursday there was no morning class only Level 3s in the evening and they had an exam based on the whole term of learning. Amandine and Mark had put it together earlier in the day from the grammar book and I had to read through and check everything made sense. Amandine and I then invigilated the exam in the evening and marked them ready for Monday’s class. Another new experience for me being the teacher wandering around the room whilst the students take the exam.\nNo teaching tomorrow.\n You might wonder what Matt’s up to whilst I’m teaching. Well he was trying to write stolencamerafinder (check it out again!) but many obstacles came his way.\nMonday we had decided to move accommodation as although Paradise was cheap and we had the basics such as bed and hot water and hammock, there was no desk or wifi, both essentials for Matt’s work. So he traipsed around Vang Vieng for the morning and moved all our stuff (in one go – would have loved to have a photo of that!) across the toll bridge to Vilay Vong. A luxurious room in comparison with gorgeous furniture, wifi and on the right side of the river but still far away from the mental bars.\nTuesday Vang Vieng had a power cut from 8.30 til 17:30. Our laptop battery only lasts 2 hours which meant lots of free thinking time for Matt.\nWednesday another powercut. They’re digging up the roads or something. Plus we had to move from Vilay Vong G.H. to Phoom Chai G.H. up the road as they’d double-booked our room. Guest House No. 3. So Matt had to move our stuff once again whilst I was at school and then later came with me to the farm in the afternoon and utilised their power supply for 4hours whilst I prepared the lesson and went to class. Had dinner at the farm too which was delicious when it finally came.\nThursday no powercut so lots of stolencamerafinder done.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/02/20/day-140-to-143-monday-31st-january-to-thursday-4th-february-vang-vieng-week-1-eefa-english-teaching-through-the-organic-farm/","summary":"Before heading to Laos I contacted the EEFA Project.

We were told we were buying a ticket for the 6 hour special VIP trip. They forgot to mention that when the 8am and 9am bus was already full, the 9:30am bus was in fact a less expensive VIP trip with no loo and dismal aircon that took longer but were happy to charge us the same price. If anyone else in Luang Prabang is going to Vang Vieng the ticket at the bus station costs only 90,000 kip for the 9:30 trip. We paid 140,000kip at a travel agent on the main street. OK it included pick up by a tuk tuk but it was only 10-min journey to the bus station. No way that cost 50,000kip! Be warned. (You do get “lunch” included which was a stop at 3pm and the journey was over at 4pm).\nAside from feeling ripped off and the suspension not being so great (one passenger looked green the whole journey and expelled his breakfast just moments before arriving in Vang Vieng poor guy), the scenery was spectacular. We navigated up and down the sides of mountains. One minute we’d be at the bottom with water running by, the next up the top with steep ravines either sides and unbelievable backdrops of the most surreal shaped hills.\nAt the top of one hill we had a loo stop and out the back of the cafe was another world:\nThey did however have the sickest thing I have ever seen and would ever want to see pickled in a jar next to the crisps and oreos. A baby bear. You could definitely make out the paws. It was disgusting.\nViews from the bus:\nArriving in the centre of Vang Vieng was a shock to the system. Bye bye beautiful buildings of Luang Prabang, hello shacks filled with bars and restaurants complete with TVs showing Friends and Family Guy on loop. On first impressions I had a bad feeling about the place and it wasn’t even evening yet).\nBut then as we headed down to the river to cross over to find the quiet guest houses we realised our beautiful Vang Vieng is surrounded by striking limestone karsts.\nWe found room at Paradise Sunset on the far side of Vang Vieng. Bamboo bungalows on stilts (fixed with nails), a balcony with fab views of the karsts beyond.\nI am torn at the moment with how I feel about Vang Vieng. It is completely schizophrenic. It has a bad vibe for me at the moment. Too many drunk kids lumbering around and loud music.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/02/20/day-138-to-139-saturday-29th-to-sunday-30th-january-vang-vieng-initial-impressions/","summary":"Vang Vieng is a 7.5 hour bus journey from LP.

We almost fell into a normal routine. We’d both be up before 8am, ready to go get a breakfast baguette \u0026amp; a strong Lao coffee or Jasmine tea from the local Lao ladies. Matt would have chicken and I would go for Lao-style which is tofu, omelette and some brown hairy stuff.\nThen we’d part ways and I’d go on my 10 min walk through the town or the morning market to Big Brother Mouse and Matt would go back to the guest house and get coding. He met a Chinese guy there who was also working. He’d been travelling around Asia for 2 years doing research on trees and their effect on agriculture.\nAfter Big Brother Mouse I would try to spend a bit more time away from the room to give Matt time to work on SCF in peace. I found the Kop Noi shop which sells locally made textiles and toiletries. They were quite expensive so I only thought I’d spend a few minutes there. When I was about to leave the guy working there pointed upstairs to the gallery. I wandered upstairs and found the fascinating Stay Another Day exhibition all about Luang Prabang and life in Laos. It was interesting to find out about life in Laos. The different tribes Hmong \u0026amp; Khmu that live here at different levels in the hills. How they make pure silk by hand in a long process from the silk worms to dyeing to weaving and the finished product. The different teas made across the country. The mulberry green tea only grown in Vang Vieng, smoked black tea in North Laos and green and golden teas in Paksong. Apparently Lao tea is drunk as a “chaser” to coffee. An hour must have passed before I left. We would meet for lunch at 13:00 and find some noodle soup or fried noodles at a local restaurant. In the afternoon I’d usually go for another wander or bug Matt enough to go with me.\nMost evenings we’d watch the sun set then eat at one of the fairy-light lit restaurants along the river. Although 2 nights in a row we succumbed to the Scandinavian pizza parlour and another night we ate at the night market buffet. A long narrow lane of food stalls where you have a plate of whatever you want (noodles, rice, veggies) for 10,000kip and sit along benches with the rest of the rabble.\nA particular restaurant became a favourite due to the alternative dishes on offer. Lao sausage served with chilly dip and peanuts and spicy marinated Lao beef on a bed of lettuce were good mains after a starter of fried Mekong river weed.\nOne afternoon I dragged Matt away from the laptop to venture up Phousi hill smack in the centre of Luang Prabang. It’s a knackering 100m climb up a twisting staircase and at the top you have almost 360° panoramic views over Luang Prabang, the Mekong river and the hills beyond. It’s breathtaking but I have to say a tad over-popular. Could hardly see the sunset for the amount of people \u0026amp; cameras waving around. Still worth the effort and the wander down the other side was just as rewarding as there are many buddha statues on the route down.\nThrough Kop Noi I found out about the UXO Lao exhibition which explains about the unexploded ordnance in Laos from American cluster bombs that bombarded the country in the 60s and 70s. It was a small room but what it displayed was shocking. Over 2 tonnes of bombs were dropped during that time and approx 8 million bombs remained after the war. Since then many people in Laos have been blown up by them and at least one person every day is maimed or killed. I found it eerie being the only visitor at that time and I saw that only one other person had signed the visitor book that day. Such a shame for an organisation that needs more exposure and more donations. I tried to ask if the American government are paying for the clean-up but the lady there couldn’t understand my question. If they’re not they should be.\nOn our last full day in Luang Prabang we hired bikes and cycled around the town following the rivers. We paid to cross a bamboo bridge to a bar overlooking the mouth of the Nam Tha flowing into the Mekong.\nMatt spotted Sylvester the snake sunning himself as we walked back along the overgrown pathway to our bikes:Other notable things in Luang Prabang:\nMorning market – this is bustling from early morning with locals buying an array of unusual items. One morning I saw a woman with a bowl of live frogs. She was trying to get one of them out from under the net which covered them without letting any others escape. They were constantly jumping up and down head-butting the net as she pulled one out and popped him into a plastic bag. Another lady sorted through a mountain of snails whilst her neighbour sits with bowls of water being pumped full of freshwater from hosepipes overflowing with different types of live fish.\nThe amount of fresh herbs, unusual fruits and vegetables are a sight for sore eyes. Especially the vibrant cerise dragonfruit (which were delicious fresh, not so interesting as a fruit shake). I would have taken a photo but was put off by the “tours” of westerners being guided through the market with their Nikons and Canons pointing everywhere.\nNight market – from 5pm the main street is closed to traffic and it is transformed into a tented marketplace with two alleyways barely 2 people wide and filled with stall after stall after stall selling bright bed coverings, wall hangings, lampshades, scarves, jewellery and handbags. Now and then is something slightly different such as a seller of Lao Lao whiskey containing snakes and scorpions or a Big Brother Mouse stand. But most of it is the same. Every evening hoards of women come with their blue and red striped plastic bags carrying their wares. Many arrive on mopeds, others pile out of the back of a truck. Everything is meticulously laid out on their spot and put away again a few hours later. There are so many stalls it takes 20minutes to walk 200metres.\nTemples – are majestic and all over town and every morning at 4 or 5am the monks bang the temple drums.\nThe book exchange – raising money for a local orphanage is a good cause. Either swap a book \u0026amp; pay 20,000 kip or buy one of the more popular ones. We were happy to donate to buy a book (which happened to be the quite dire The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). It’s a shame the woman running it in her grand house in the most expensive part of Luang Prabang couldn’t have been a little more pleasant else I wouldn’t have felt so reluctant to give to the charity. We felt that she seemed to spend most of her time making signs to put people off rather than helping the orphanage. One sign said something like “Beware of the Dog. If you try to pat the dog or leave the premises she may bite. You have been warned. We accept no responsibility.” Plus “If you steal you are stealing from the children.” And “These books over here are for the owner to read first. These are not for exchange. Only when the owner decides she is finished with the book will these books be made available for swapping”. Um excuse me? If I donate a book I expect it to go straight on the shelf. Not to be used by the owner first. It winds I right up.\nTo end on a much more positive note we loved Luang Prabang. It is the most chilled place we have been to so far on our travels. It may be a little pretentious and there are possibly too many outsiders who have set up business here but it is a beautiful place with friendly people and we could have stayed indefinitely. Definitely a recommendation to anyone thinking of coming to SE Asia.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/02/18/day-133-to-137-cont-luang-prabang-phousi-hill-kop-noi-uxo-lao-sunsets/","summary":"Whilst I spent my mornings at Big Brother Mouse, Matt concentrated on stolencamerafinder (check it out!).

This has to be one of our favourite places of the trip for easy living. It is a beautiful place and the people are so friendly.\nI have been volunteering at Big Brother Mouse, a local charity which creates books for kids in Lao and English. They encourage tourists to buy books from their shop or from the market to give to kids who live in villages. If you have enough money you can sponsor a “book party” where they go to a village and tell the kids about books, play games with them and let them select a book each. Or you can sponsor a book itself to get it published. Unfortunately I don’t have that kind of money at the moment but fortunately it’s possible to help out in other ways. So I spent 2 hours every morning this week going to their office and chatting to young Lao people who want to improve their English. They were mainly 18 \u0026amp; 19 year old students and one or two locals who are working in tourism.\nIt was a really interesting experience. Pretty much every day you’d get asked the same questions. What is your name? Where do you come from? How long are you in Luang Prabang? Where are you travelling. But you’d also get asked many different things. Some of the guys there asked for meanings of words from a brochure they’d found. Like “sanctuaries”, “fermenting” and “nonetheless” – try explaining those in simple English! Another seemed to be reading through his Lao-English dictionary so would ask how to pronounce words like assiduous and also ask the meaning. I still haven’t looked that one up yet so if anyone knows, please post in the comments bit at the bottom!\nAnother asked me what I thought of gay relationships. Then asked whether I thought he looked gay! Because he hangs around with his best mate who is gay and lots of people say he looks it!\nSompanh, a student, was there 4 days in a row and one day he read me part of a traditional Lao story so that I could help with pronunciation and meaning of some words. It was quite a young story about a boy named Toukata who lived in the forest, married a girl who appeared from an egg and had to compete with the god of the city for her hand in marriage by having a cock-fight. Toukata’s cock turned into a wolf so he won his wife back.\nHe also asked me to read two pages he’d written in English. One was an overview about himself and his family and how he’d built the bottom floor of the family home. He lives in Luang Prabang away from his family who live in a village in the hills. He goes to school every weekday, has extra English classes on Saturdays and works as a night watchman in a guest house from 9pm til 7am every night. To build part of the family home, he had to cycle home every Saturday and work on it for 90mins before cycling back to Luang Prabang to work. And he comes to Big Brother Mouse when he can fit it in. This week he could come every day because they had a week’s holiday.\nI was utterly gobsmacked how eager these guys are to study and learn English. On Thursday night I bought a few books from the Big Brother Mouse market stall. The guy selling them happened to be the illustrator of one of the books I bought.\nI bought Doctor Dolittle (in Lao \u0026amp; English) and hoped to give it to Sompanh on Friday. I couldn’t believe it he wasn’t there. I feared it was because on Thursday he’s not been able to get a word in edgeways as I had 3 of them to talk to and his friend just wouldn’t shut up. He was very strongly opinionated about many things. Especially about how you should use your free time. You should study and help out at home instead of playing computer games and playing football. He couldn’t see the benefit of doing some sport. He was the best English speaker there so maybe he had a point?!\nAnyway Friday I ended up speaking to a variety of people as there was only me and one other volunteer there. Usually 4 or 5 turned up. But Sompanh wasn’t there. I guess he needed a day off.\nInstead I spoke to a trainee English teacher who was completely disillusioned by the whole thing. He didn’t feel he was being taught the right skills and that he would just have to go into it blindly. Really he wanted to run his own travel business but it was too late, he had already started the teacher course and had to complete it. I told him about the teaching techniques I’d learned in my TEFL course and although he was interested he said there was no way he could play any games or anything. He had to follow the book.\nThat is one thing that I have found everyone has the same opinion on here. Lao teachers of English don’t know enough English to teach it properly. And it is taught in such a dull way that they don’t learn. Which is why many go to Big Brother Mouse.\nFinally to conclude my Big Brother Mouse experience I chatted to a guy who had just started working at a Luang Prabang restaurant and needed to improve his English. It was his first time at Big Brother Mouse and he struggled to understand much of what I was saying. However he had a list of words from the menu which he wanted to me to pronounce for him. Amongst others they consisted of “sticky rice, strawberry hibiscus and scratch*”. A very strange list of words but he seemed pleased to have learned how to say them. As time was up he started panicking and saying, tell me 2 more words in English. Like what? I asked. Anything, anything he said. How do you think of 2 words just there on the spot?? I suddenly remembered I had the books in my bag and one was an A-Z of English words with pictures. I pulled it out and the first page it landed on was the letter G. He started poring over it and pointing at words. “Glove, glass, etc”. He seemed happy to have learned 2 completely random words.\nSo I gave him the A-Z book to keep. That was what it was meant for. To help a Lao person learn English. I cannot describe the look of delight on his face. I almost cried. He was so so grateful and ecstatic that he could keep this book. He kept saying Kop Jai (thank you) over and over with his palms together and bowing his head. He wanted me to go to his restaurant Utopia this evening to see him at work. We didn’t make it there but it’s so good to know that I may have helped someone get a bit closer to where they want to go.\n* whilst in Vang Vieng I spotted a menu that said “all our dishes are made from scratch”. Now it makes sense!\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/02/13/day-133-to-137-monday-24th-to-friday-28th-january-luang-prabang-volunteering-at-big-brother-mouse/","summary":"After 7 days in Luang Prabang we are still not ready to leave.

Having woken up at 7.15am to get on a boat to sit for 3 hours until it left. Seems that’s the Lao way.\nThe cruise down the Mekong river to Pak Beng was a long 6 hours but beautiful. The landscape consists of pointed hills, small huts on stilts dotted around or grouped in villages, sandy beaches and large glossy grey rocks protruding from the water. Lots of locals fishing by hand and lots of unguarded fishing rods and nets securely fastened on rocks to avoid being swept away in the fast currents. And every so often a speedboat would pass us in the fast lane to Luang Prabang…\n To keep everyone occupied they sold Beerlao, pot noodles and crisps on the boat. Nutritious. And there was the token guitar playing traveller who kept everyone aurally entertained especially the young lassies.\nArriving in Pak Beng it felt like being back in India. Bombarded with guest house touts trying to get to you before you ‘d even got off the boat. I joked to Matt that one would be sat next to us in a moment and 2 mins later one was coming down the side of the seats!\nIt really doesn’t feel like we’re in the middle of Laos right now though. I don’t know what I expected but we’re on a strip of guesthouses and restaurants and shops that could be Varkala, could be Koh Phi Phi. So touristy. But as Matt says we are tourists.

As we de-bussed at Chiang Khong, they were asking us the way to Vang Vieng. Umm Vang Vieng is in Laos yes but it’s quite far away. Kind of nearer to Vientiane than Huay Xai. We want Laos not Vietnam and what is Huay Xai? Well Vientiane is capital of Laos and Huay Xai is the only border crossing between here and Vientiane we believe. When do you need to get there by? Today. Ah might be a problem. We’ll be getting a 2-day boat trip to Luang Prabang and then its another 6-8 hours bus from there. You can probably get a bus or something though.\nMerde!, they were not happy bunnies. They had just come up from Chiang Mai to cross the border to Laos expecting Vang Vieng to be just a couple of hours away. We think they’d neglected to tell anyone they wanted Vang Vieng, instead just saying Laos and not realising how big a country it is. Turns out they had to head back to Chiang Mai to get anywhere near Vang Vieng in the next 24 hours! Poor buggers. They had no guidebook, no map. And their faces were a picture. Even we’re not that disorganised!\nAnyway if you do want to get to Huay Xai, Thailand side of the Mekong you get your passport stamped at a little hatch, pay 40THB each to get a longtail across the river and at the other side fill in 2 forms, pay $35 each at another booth and you’re in Laos. Easy peasy.\nWe checked into B.A.P. Guesthouse and the little old lady booked us a slow boat to Luang Prabang starting at 8.30 tomorrow. We were going to shop around but it was like your nan booking it for you so we couldn’t say no.\nHuay Xai seems to be a 1-street pony but it’s good enough for a 1 night stay. We found a good BBQ place down on the right past the Sabydee guesthouse and the T-junction. He knew exactly what we wanted. 2 Beerlao and plate of barbequed meat with chilli \u0026amp; coriander dip. Delish.\nAs we left dusk was coming so we headed to Riverside restaurant which overlooks the Mekong and watched the sun set over Thailand. Beautiful.\nJust need to get used to the new currency again. 12,000 kip to the £1. When we withdrew £80 from the cashpoint earlier we were millionaires for 5mins until we checked into the guesthouse.\nAt Bar How? I opted for a glass of Melacca wine which has many healthy properties including improvement of circulation and the intestinal tract. It was like thin sweet sherry and very tasty.

He said his sons still live in the capital of Myanmar and it’s a hard life because of military rule. I wonder if he ever sees them. We don’t know what the deal is with people leaving or visiting Myanmar. There are a certain number of tourist visas permitted each year but they still restrict the areas you can visit.\nIf anyone is wondering why we only went to Tachileik. It’s because you can only get a one day permit to go to Tachileik only. It is possible to get a 14 day visa to go to Kengtung and Mong La but you can’t go any further into Myanmar than that without applying for the special visa which we’re not keen to do. We do wonder what it’s like though. It can’t be like Tachileik. A strange no-mans land.\nBy 16:30 we were back in Chiang Rai.\n Tried another different cuisine tonight. Korean. An array of dishes appeared on the table with a large jug of cold weak tea.

It was good to talk to someone that was so familiar with the places we know and that had the same appetite for beer as us so we ended up in a bar in Chiang Rai for the rest of the day.\nMark had been in Australia and so was able to give us advice about where to go and funnily enough he is off to India next so we were able to offload lots of useless information onto him about what to expect.\nNot sure what to think of Chiang Rai.

A bus with 2 seats one side, 3 seats the other side (similar to before) but with fans and windows that open instead of aircon. And it was perfectly fine.

It felt like a retro American diner with turquoise seats, metal trims and metal ceiling. No dodgy pattern seats in sight.\nThaton is close to the Myanmar border and was the quietest place we have been to in Thailand. Hardly any tourists or inhabitants for that matter. A few restaurants and guest houses alongside the river. We found the cheapest accommodation we’ve stayed in in Thailand. Naam Waan (or Nam Whan, depending on which sign you look at – why is everything spelled differently?!) guesthouse, for 200THB. Run by a shy couple, it was a terrace of small chalets in their back garden. And the first cold shower for a long time. Not lukewarm like many places. Absolutely freezing! As Thaton is further north again when the sun disappears so does the heat so we’ve been feeling cold quite a bit recently. Can’t complain at that price though.\nWe did see lots of visitors at the Wat Thaton, however. A temple at the top of a 3km winding road with 8 other levels of temples and statues for viewing on the way up. As we puffed up the hill, sorng thaew passing us now and then with people shouting hello and waving, we could see the burning red sun setting beyond the trees and just made it to the top of the temple as the the sun went behind the clouds. It didn’t matter really. The temple was impressive itself. A relatively new circular building with a winding slope up through the centre decorated with dragon scales which ended at a shrine at the top guarded by a silver and gold dragon. A balcony around the outside gave fantastic 360 degree views across Thaton and further to the hills of Chiang Rai and to Myanmar on the opposite side.\n ","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/02/08/day-125-sunday-16th-january-thaton/","summary":"Dragged Matt out of bed early so we could make it to the bus station for the 9am bus to Thaton.

It’s meant to get rid of dead skin and revitalise and soften your feet. Matt had about 5 times as many fish in his tank than I did so whilst I found it quite pleasant and gentle most of the time he felt like he was being attacked at first. Although once the fish were filling up and/or his feet were numb he didn’t mind it so much. I on the other hand had a mossie bite they managed to attack and that became quite painful. Like little needles sticking in you. We only stayed in for 15mins so it didn’t make our feet baby fresh but they were definitely a little softer and I wouldn’t say no to having it done again.\n Tried Burmese food for dinner tonight. Something new. In a restaurant that sounded more like an English pub than Burmese. We chose our dishes and then realised we were having what was pictured on the menu. Very Derren Brown. So we only had to point at the photos like true tourists. Was delicious too.\nI always think I’m not a fan of boxing but when I happen to see one on TV I can get into it which is what happened with the Muay Thai boxing match we went to Friday night. “Kalare Boxing Stadium” was an outdoor ring setup on a scrap bit of land behind the night market with rows of plastic patio chairs filled with tourists drinking cans of Chang.\nThe first match was between a 12-year old and a 13-year old. They looked so young and I wasn’t sure about staying to watch but turns out they can be more vicious than the older guys. The commentator said they do 2-3 hours of training everyday after school and only after at least 6 months do they start fighting in matches.\nAll the fighters do a ritual before they fight, rocking on their legs in the centre of the ring and moving their arms around then kissing each corner of the ring.\nThe next match were 18 year olds (not considered professional) and then 60kg and 62kg adult professional fights. It was interesting to see the difference in skills from young to professional. Matt got right up at the ringside (and even on the ringside at one point) to take some incredible action shots whilst I watched from my plastic seat ouching and oohing but still watching. Being the most excited when one knocked the other down [Haha. Brillliant. –Ed].\nMatt up close \u0026amp; personal\nSeeing the skills of the previous guys made for a disappointing “international” match between an English guy and Thai guy which seemed to have been advertised as the main event. All the boxers had sixpacks because of the amount of training they do except this last Thai guy who was slightly chubby. It was embarrassing to watch. We wondered if they’d just asked two guys on the street to fight. I guess you have to start somewhere.\nAs I said there were a lot of tourists there and everywhere you walk in Chiang Mai you see posters or are handed flyers for the next fight. So I wonder if the business of Muay Thai Boxing is kept alive by actually being an age-old Thai tradition or just by tourists who believe they’re seeing an age-old tradition.\n 15th – We wanted to do something adventurous as Chiang Mai is known for it’s outdoor activities such as white water rafting, trekking and zipwires but that all seemed a bit too expensive so we opted for Thai Farm Cooking Class :) I’ve always wanted to learn how to make a Thai curry paste and what better place to learn.\nHad a really lovely day. We were picked up and taken to a local market where Max our teacher talked about different sauces and rices. Then on we went 20km north of Chiang Mai to an organic farm with a similar feel to Butterfly. Lots of lily ponds and flowers and large wooden rustic buildings. And we spent the day cooking thai curry, tom yum shrimp soup, pad thai, spring rolls, papaya salad, chicken with basil and mango and sticky rice ( which sounds weird but is absolutely delicious).

I was a little concerned because the resort was on the outskirts of Chiang Mai and I was worried we’d be too far away from bars and restaurants for celebrating.\nI needn’t have worried. It could not have been more perfect, even if I do say so myself :)\nThe place was like a dream realised. I am not exaggerating.\nEven the first people we met in Chiang Mai were nice. We asked a taxi drive [is that a typo or are you proper Brizzle now? -Ed] at the bus station to take us to Butterfly and he said he was too expensive to go that distance and recommended we take a tuk-tuk instead. How often does that happen in Bristol? Nah you don’t need to use me mate, take that there bus number 10 instead and it’ll be half the price. Or at Bristol airport there’s a few of you about to get on the airport bus to the centre and the driver says don’t be silly a cab for 4 of you will save you money.\nAnyway enough whinging about transport in Brizzle. As soon as we arrived at Butterfly we were met by smiling helpful people offering to carry bags. Whilst we waited to check in we were brought pineapple juice. To get into the resort you walked through two big solid natural wooden doors that led into the grounds. It was set in huge grounds overlooking Ping River with ponds and fountains and stepping stones, different flowers and giant trees and a swimming pool.\nOur room (ground floor)\nAnd the room. Wow. It was bigger than the flat we used to own. The bedroom was so big it had a sofa in it. There was a small side garden with a table, chairs and canopy umbrella. The bathroom was something else. It had a bathtub. Not just any kind of bathtub. But a jacuzzi bathtub. And the room had folding glass doors that led into the back garden with an outdoor shower!\nI had emailed them to ask them if 1. would it be possible to have breakfast in our room on 12th and 2. did they know anywhere I could get a birthday cake from. They couldn’t have been more helpful. They emailed a local cake shop URL http://www.loveatfirstbite-cm.com to me so I could choose the cake and they arranged for their shuttle driver to pick it up. Plus instead of eating in the room they said I could reserve a table overlooking the river.\nTrying to get Matt out of bed and ready for brekkie at 9am was a challenge though. He couldn’t understand why I wanted to get up so “early” on his birthday!\nThey were so sweet at Butterfly. Our table was laid out miles away from anyone else with a vase of roses and they brought us any food we wanted.\nFollowed by the most delicious dark chocolate cake… Spent the rest of the day having pressies, lounging by the pool, freezing our backsides off in the pool (and getting a teeny bit of exercise for once) and having chocolate cake and beer in the Jacuzzi. :)\nCaught the 6pm shuttlebus to Riverside for a pre-dinner drink followed by a scrummy dinner at the nearby restaurant XXXX with a sofa for seats overlooking the river. Treated ourselves to a bottle of Cabernet-Merlot. The first full-sized bottle of red in 4 months ( a record for us) which was kindly poured by the staff mouthful by mouthful. It took us hours to drink that bottle.\nEnded up back in Riverside to watch some local bands doing excellent covers of bands we actually know like the Killers and drinking beer and rum and finally whiskey with the locals. Everyone was coming into the bar with a bottle of Jack Daniels or some other kind of whiskey and the barmaid brings jugs of water and ice over as a mixer.\nAll in all a pretty good day. Matt does agree with everything I’ve written here. I did ask him to write it as it was his birthday but he couldn’t be arsed [I agree with that too. –Ed] so my account will have to do.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/01/20/day-120-121-tuesday-11th-to-wednesday-12th-january-chiang-mai-phase-1-matts-30th-birthday/","summary":"On Christmas Day in Ko Lanta I said Does life get any better than this?

This time 1st class so normal sized seats but included a free lunch stop at a service station. You could choose what you wanted from an array of dishes and Matt \u0026amp; I both chose at random as we had no idea what anything was. The server said “Spicy” in a way that we shouldn’t want it but yes of course we want it. We’ll try anything once. Still no idea after eating it what any of it was but the flavours and tingly spices were spot on.\nHopped on a sorng taaow to The Garden House, the cheapest place we’ve stayed in Thailand so far. It’s a lovely little place with cosy bamboo bungalows with decent flooring (no gaps this time), free wifi and cheap beer. Our only real gripe wasn’t with the accommodation but with early morning risers of Sukhothai. At 7am on Monday morning we were awoken by some woman nattering in Thai through a loudspeaker. At 8am, admittedly we should have been getting up by then, someone decided to mow the lawn next door with a contraption that sounded like a didgeredoo. More original alarm clock than cockerels crowing I guess.\nBefore visiting the main historical park we headed to Wat Thawet Learning Garden 8km away on a tuk-tuk where the seats are at the front and the driver is at the back. The sun hadn’t appeared yet so it was a bit chilly and felt strange to be cold after so long in the heat. Although it was still probably a heatwave compared to UK weather.\nWat Thawet is the realisation of a Buddhist’s monk’s dream. It’s not well maintained so is a little overgrown and damaged in places but that added to the creepiness to the place. We were the only visitors. The grounds were filled with different characters and animals and a 20ft Buddha. Some were brightly painted ala Mary Rose Young. Others were grey and dull as they were the grim tormented souls. Matt’s photos will explain more:\nBack in New Sukhothai we found the bus to the old city. I say a bus. It was a toyota truck or van with most of the body cut away and what seemed like an old boat structure at the back. A large sorng taaow. Long benches down either side. And glass-less windows. Maximum speed 20mph.\nAt the park we hired bikes again and the sun had come out in all it’s glory so we dodged from shade to temple to shade.\nSukhothai was the original capital of Siam after the Khmer empire and before Ayutthaya. It is different to Ayutthaya in that the main temples are in a beautiful landscaped park with lotus ponds. It was very serene. We did have a bit of a shock though when we saw a rail of tied plastic bags containing water and an array of creatures – turtle, snake, fish, toad – all in the same bag. I want to believe they were just being stored whilst the water was cleaned but they were probably destined for gloomier futures.\nWe ate in the local market. A couple of sausages on sticks which turned out to contain rice and meat. When going back to the same stall for more an “affray” broke out between a woman on another stall and a guy. I just happened to see as the woman walked towards me, the guy picked up a plastic stool and threw it at her. Then started trying to attack her. The lady on the sausage stall stood between them and we were unsure what to do. The guy just shouted in Thai and then leaped at them both so I started shouting at him but he completely ignored me. Matt was ready to step in and everyone else just stood and watched. The guy left for 2 mins and came back with a bike with a baby on the front. He proceeded to try to attack the woman once more and in the process almost dropped his baby who was caught by a young girl. Matt started towards him and he rode off on his bike with baby.\nIt was such a difficult situation. We had no idea what was going on because we can’t understand Thai yet we couldn’t stand and watch. Regardless of what this woman had done, the guy was out-of-order attacking her and we were in the middle of it when it happened. The poor sausage woman was shaking afterwards and was grateful to Matt for helping. He also got a cheer from another stallholder as we walked through the market!\nThat wasn’t our only experience of the day with a creepy guy. 12:30am, fast asleep in our hut, we woke up to find someone bumbling about on our balcony and then trying to open the door. He was a drunk Frenchman who had forgotten which room he was in but didn’t seem to understand that our room wasn’t his room. So kept coming back until I shouted at him to go away and probably woke the whole resort! Matt had wanted to do the sensible thing and go and talk to the guy but me having an over-active imagination thought he’d be an axe-murderer so I wouldn’t let him go. I ended up sleeping fully-clothed incase the madman came back and managed to break his way in!\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/01/18/day-118-119-sunday-9th-to-monday-10th-january-sukhothai/","summary":"Arrived in Sukhothai after a 5.5 hour bus journey.

It’s kind of a birthday pressie for him. No stress of having to worry about route or accommodation. So I’ve booked the next few days already.\nOur first train experience in Thailand from Bangkok to Ayutthaya was pleasant. Although not sleeper trains it reminded us of India with the shutters and open windows and people walking by with baskets of sandwiches, drinks and dried fish. This is a common sight in Thailand. Dried fish are sold on streetstalls and in markets and have a strange petshop aroma. We’ve yet to try one.\nWe are only here 1 day so after checking in at the youth hostel we hired bikes to explore the city. It’s not a very bike-friendly place but it’s a good way of getting around as the temples are spread out.\nWe saw the main tourist sight Wat Phra Mahathat with the Buddha head caught between the roots of a tree. It was much smaller than we envisaged as the photos we had seen contain only roots and the head so it is difficult to tell the perspective without seeing it for real.\nAyuthaya is an island surrounded by 3 rivers and we fancied a boat trip around the city to see some of the other temples. Do you think we could find out anything about them? I called the hostel and the guy’s English wasn’t so good so he ended up just telling me that they close the gate at 11pm. We cycled round the riversides but couldn’t see anything advertised. So gave up and went to see the reclining Buddha. This one is outside unlike in Bangkok and was being renovated so it was surrounded by what looked like oil drums and had a large ladder leaning against it. Not so photogenic as Matt would have liked.\nFor dinner I pretended I didn’t know where we were going and took Matt down this random road that looked like nowhere. I was beginning to think it really was leading nowhere then luckily spotted a small sign for the place Baan Khun Phra which was a riverside restaurant opposite a temple with a shimmering golden reflection. Lush.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/01/18/day-117-saturday-8th-january-ayutthaya/","summary":"From now on Matt doesn’t know where we’re going or staying.

The place was filled with giant malls, street sellers and small narrow back alleys filled with cute little clothes shops. A shopper’s heaven. I could have spent a fortune.\nSpent an extremely long time in MBK mall. The food mall was enormous. You buy coupons from the cashier and then go to one of the 40 food places to get your food. Each place doing a different dish. Also went to Central World Plaza mall in Siam Square and they had the new Mazda concept car on display which was lush! Look at those doors!\nThe reason for going here was to find the Skybar in the hotel there but we couldn’t even find the hotel so gave up and opted to go to another hotel with a high-level Moonbar for views of the sunset over Bangkok. Tried out the skytrain which we only ended up going one stop on and then realising the scale of the map was completely out as we walked for over half hour to get to Banyan Tree Hotel.\nWe’d heard that they had dress-codes and we weren’t exactly looking the part in our travelling clothes and flipflops. Anyway we tried to get in but was embarrassingly turned away because of our open-toed shoes. Ridiculous nonsense. The only non-open-toed shoes I have with me are my running trainers. Should I wear those with my dress next time? Who makes up these snobby rules. Grrr.\nDisgruntled we wandered back towards the skytrain in the dark and found a good old Irish pub called Molly Malones. There was no dress-code here. Instead it was happy hour and we drank our working glass beer out of Stowford Press pint glasses whilst wearing our open-toed feet attire. Outside Molly Malones was an array of streetstalls and we found the busiest and had Kuay Taew – a delicious pork and vegetable soup served with a portion of rice on the side. Streetfood is so very good.\nOpposite here was a night market called Patpong market. We hadn’t realised the kind of neighbourhood we were in until we walked through here. The knock-off crap they were selling wasn’t the interesting part. It was the proposition after proposition from pingpong show salesmen. They’d sidle up and flash a card at you with a full menu of pingpong shows available and quickly hide it again. It was brilliant! No we didn’t go to one.\nReturning to Khao San Road, absolutely heaving with people, market stalls, streetfood, buckets, breakdancing kids, loud music.\nWe decided not to hang around as this was not Bangkok to us. It was such a fake touristy street. Like some cheesy Spanish resort.\nWe also had a problem to sort out. We’d found out today that our travel insurance was only valid for the UK. WTF! Somehow we’d managed not to select the right option when buying it online (I HATE COMPUTERS!) so it was invalid for Matt’s India hospital claim.\nWe spent over an hour on Skype to Endsleigh and finally sorted out proper global insurance which you’d expect from “gap year” insurance for an extra £300. Ouch. There goes more of the budget. We are just happy we found out on a small claim rather than something huge.\nIt was gone 11 by the time we’d dealt with it all so to de-stress we went to one of the restaurants on Soi Ram Buttri for more curry and beer and watched the street masseuses rub down half-drunk farang lying on sunloungers. A bizarre sight in the middle of a street. And unfortunately very like Khao San Road. But that was the area we were staying so I’m being a hypocrite here. The kind of area you need to have this notice three times on the same board in the hotel! What have we westerners done to this country?\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/01/18/day-116-friday-7th-january-bangkok-shopping/","summary":"Got a taxi to the Siam Square area of Bangkok to go shopping!

Not that we realised all of this until we got on the bus. We’d stuffed ourselves beforehand so a stop with free buffet was a surprise.\nAnother surprise came at 3am when the onboard hostess tapped me on the head twice to wake me and give me a refreshing towel. Followed by coffee. Bit of a shock to the system.\nThe bus arrived at Bangkok eastern bus terminal at 4.45am and Matt found a local bus (no. 511) going to Banglamphu. By 5.30am we were wandering the streets of Bangkok looking for accommodation. Passing pissed people still drinking in Khao San and taxi drivers and ladyboys. The place was buzzing for such an early time.\nNowhere had room. Well except for one but in the 10mins it took us to wander out and decide and wander back in some other people got in there. We tried a 24hour internet cafe where the the guy working there was asleep dribbling onto his desk. Found a direction to walk in and was about to head there when we decided to try our first choice Siam again. They had a room! It would be ready at 8 so we sat and had brekkie in our zombie state until it was ready. By that time the drinkers had been replaced with breakfasters and people checking out of hotels.\nAs always we headed out to do some sightseeing at the hottest time of the day – 12:00 – and boiled ourselves whilst walking to the Grand Palace. After munching on some delicious crab ball kebabs we covered ourselves up with trouser legs (Matt) and shawl (Karen) to comply with the no bare shoulders/legs rules and wandered through the gates. Only to be stopped by a guard who told me a shawl wasn’t good enough and I had to queue and borrow a top. Grrrr. After 15mins of queuing we then saw that it cost a fortune to actually get into the place anyway so we turned around and left.\nAnd ended up in an amazing place for a 7th of the price called Wat Pho with a gigantic golden reclining Buddha, temples and many many small Buddha statues being painstakingly restored with gold leaf. It was beautiful. We donated 20THB to get a pot of small coins that you dropped in larger pots situated all the way down the back of the building making a wish for each one.\n Gold reclining buddha\nMother of pearl feet Wishing pots\nWithin the grounds of Wat Pho\nSmall Buddha statues\nMaintenance Unusual sculptures The stone ball in the mouth of this Singha (guardian lion) cannot be removed unusual foliage\nWe must have spent a good couple of hours wandering around Wat Pho so that was us templed out.

Back to the proper mainland and the rest of Thailand.\nOur last bit of Railay sightseeing was the Diamond Cave. We’d walked past it every time we’d been anywhere away from Railay Cabana.\nOn the way to the cave Matt informed me what had been in his towel…a scorpion. Which had crawled on him. Only when he’d knocked it onto the ground had he seen what it was. Yep glad I didn’t ask before we’d checked out.\nThis time we booked our longtail trip and transfer to Krabi through a travel agent at Viewpoint in Railay. That meant a tractor \u0026amp; trailer lift out to the longtail – no soggy ankles for a change – and a luxurious limo style minibus to the centre of Krabi. Nice.\nStayed at Pak Up Hostel just metres away from the drop-off point. We were going to opt for dorm beds as we hadn’t tried it yet and we’re trying to get back to budget spending. However the woman gave us an offer we couldn’t refuse. For an extra 100THB we could have a private room. So the 2 of us ended up in an 8-bed dorm called History (Pakup had a school theme). It was huge! The hostel was obviously relatively new. The furniture was good quality, the walls were white and clean, the common area had cool beanbags and funky retro sofas. And the rooftop bar was classy. It was more of a grown-up version of Footprints Hostel in Singapore.\nKrabi didn’t seem like it had much to offer but Matt could have stayed there forever after walking into the Relax Coffee \u0026amp; Restaurant opposite Pakup, realising they did bangers \u0026amp; mash (which coincidentally he’d only been craving earlier that day) and it being the best sausages \u0026amp; mash \u0026amp; gravy he’d ever had. Better than mine apparently.\nWalking around the waterfront we encountered a bizarre sight. Hundreds of one-claw miniature crabs waving their one claw around in the air like some kind of ritual. And even more bizarrely some creatures moving in and out of the water that looked like part of the evolutionary chain. Kind of large slugs with gills. No idea what they were.\nKrabi came alive in the evening with a large street market with neon lights. Stalls selling all kinds of food, mostly bar-b-qued – chicken legs with the foot still on, squid and octopus kebabs, larvae and grasshoppers, your usual noodles and lots of sweet squidgy things filled with orange or green gunge or that sickly fake marshmallow-like cream.\nOur favourite purchase was an ice-lolly made from fanta. A woman sat with a big metal tub filled with mini-milk shape containers which she topped up with fanta and a kebab stick and hey presto instant lolly. We figured the tub must have been contained liquid nitrogen for them to freeze so quickly. What a genius idea.\nAnother area of the market was full of homemade fairground games. How many balloons can you burst with darts, can you throw a ping-pong ball into a pot with the hole half a mm wider than the ping pong ball or catch a balloon going round a big plastic greenhouse?? (We didn’t get this game).\nOn Tuesday we tried to get bus tickets to Bangkok without success. Most buses were full or crappy tourist buses that we’d heard you shouldn’t travel on. Matt did some investigation and had this confirmed by an experienced traveller now working in a local tourist travel agents when he should have been trying to flog us tourist bus tickets. Very kind of him. He did offer government tickets for 1150 THB I think it was which was way more than what we thought.\nMatt eventually got a sǎwngthǎew to the bus station and got us tickets on the next government VIP bus available from a reluctant teller who just didn’t want to give him any information or tickets whatsoever until she had to give in as she was the only person selling VIP tickets to Bangkok! Anyway that bus wasn’t until Wednesday evening (and cost only 950 THB each) so we checked back into Pakup into the same History dorm with just the two of us and had another groundhog day.\nWhich was fine as we spent Wednesday eating more good food at ‘Relax Coffee and Restaurant’ and then having a nose around Krabi and finding these fascinating traffic lights at a crossroads. There was one on each side. How do people think of these things? (Notice the green counter? This is on most traffic lights in Thailand for cars \u0026amp; pedestrians. Green (unsurprisingly) tells you how long it will stay green for. Red numbers tell you how long you have left to wait for. Great idea.

It is reachable by longtail from West beach, by walking from West beach (we believe) or by walking from Railay East. The pathway from East is right outside Railay Cabana so it was an easy choice to make. Not so easy walk though although it was lovely to walk through the jungle and see more amazing butterflies, we saw the “Tsunami village” where there were a few shells of buildings. We couldn’t quite believe the wave had reached so far inland. The toughest part was a steep climb upwards as the beach is the other side of the rocks behind our bamboo hut. It was so steep there were climbing ropes tied along it to help keep your balance. I ended up on my ass typically on the way down the other side.\nThe sign says 800m to Ton Sai beach from Railay Cabana. That is a big fib. It is twice as far as once you get to the first set of shops and restaurants is another 10min walk to the beach. It’s also not as nice a beach for sunbathing or paddling as West or Phranang as it’s more stony than sandy but still has incredible views and lovely beach eateries. It’s more for climbers as there were many on the cliffs at either end of the beach.\nHat Tonsai\nWe caught the longtail back to West beach and hired a kayak to paddle to Phranang beach and out to the rocks we could see from the beach. It became quite a hairy experience at one point as we paddled around one of the large karsts. The wind had picked up and we were not really in control of where we were headed for a few minutes. One minute we were angled out to sea, the next towards the rocks.

He didn’t tell me what he found in his towel after a shower and I don’t want to know…\nWent exploring to find the famous Hat Phranang, one of the top beaches in Thailand according to LP. And it was beautiful. Even the walk there was fascinating. There is a path that winds along the side of and underneath a huge rock where giant stalactites and stalagmites have formed and the trees are so tall you can’t see the top and branches hanging down are higher than houses. Phranang beach itself is a curve of gorgeous yellow sands and crystal clear water with views of more limestone karsts jutting out of the sea and longtails floating around\n We sat on the beach with a can of Chang, bought from a random Thai guy with a carrier-bag of ice \u0026amp; beer, until the rains came and we were forced to sprint back to the shelter of the stalactites and then the 15min walk back up to Railay Cabana to get ready for new year.\nI wore my new dress at last! And we headed down to YaYa bar for a delicious cocktail and then to Skunk Bar in Railay East for more cocktails, free kebab, free bodypaint and a freaky persian cat that didn’t seem to mind being picked up by some Italians and danced with on the table.\nAt 11:45 the place was practically empty and we were starting to think we were missing something. It was almost bong time and where was everyone? Luckily Matt asked a group who were heading out the door where they were off to and they said Railay West beach for the new year celebrations. Shit! We had to get a move on. Railay West Beach was a good 10mins away in daylight and with normal clothes on. In a dress and super-thin flipflops at nearly midnight it was going to be a challenge. We absolutely legged it from Skunk Bar to the west and somehow we managed to make it with 1min to spare – just enough time to buy a beer. Ah this was where everyone was. The beach was packed with people and at midnight the whole place exploded with fireworks and chinese lanterns and music. Wonderful.\nBack to Railay East and to Last Bar, literally the last bar on the strip, and they have a big raised platform on stilts over the water with floor cushions. We found ourselves a nice little table to sit at and when we’d drunk enough we danced the night away until 3:30am when Matt realised it was time to go back [Karen suddenly found a level of drunkness so new they haven’t got a word for it yet. -ed]. Stupidly I accidentally dropped my bag and the contents of it on a dark pathway on the way home and although we found the contents we couldn’t find the bag.

Intention was to check out Ao Nang and then go onto Railay. Settled down on a ledge at the back of the ferry alfresco and watched beautiful angelfish darting around the coral attached to the jetty. Why fish want to hang around large ferries with their engines blasting and amongst fag butts is beyond me.\nOne and a half hours later we pulled up at Krabi to find the free bus actually cost 100Baht each. Accosted by a taxi driver who said he could get us to Railay quicker and for the same price (after bartering and 10mins umming \u0026amp; ahhing) we naively agreed. Once in the car we were like hang on a minute didn’t we want to go to Ao Nang first anyway? Doh. Oh well a half hour wait at the new local longtail stop “Nammao” or something like that south of Krabi and we were piled ungraciously into a longtail boat after a wade into a foot of water with a holidaying couple who said Railay was no where near as nice as the islands and they were getting out as quickly as possible to go to Ko Lanta. Great, we thought, we have picked the worst place to spend New Year!\nWell apart from that initial obstacle of getting to Railay \u0026amp; being put off, we realised quite quickly that we should ignore that couple altogether as we love Railay. It has the best of all worlds.\nThe only way to get to Railay is by boat. Even though it is part of the mainland it is cut off from everything by massive limestone rocks which are more awe-inspiring that Ko Phi Phi. There are 4 main beaches. Railay East is the backpackers side and not for sunbathing but has cool bars and cafes, cheap local eats and a good vibe. A 5 min walk took us to the opposite beach at Railay West which is exactly like Ao Lam Dam on Phi Phi except a bit more upmarket. There is Phra Nang beach which is beautiful and Ton Sai beach that is more rocky but good for rock climbers.\nSorry sounding liking a travel guide now so won’t go on too much longer. (SORRY I LIED)\nOur accommodation may not be the best we’ve had. We’re at Railay Cabana which is the furthest point from anywhere in East Railay but the setting is gorgeous. Surrounded by more limestone rocks, we are in a basic bamboo bungalow on stilts with a balcony overlooking all kinds of plants and trees and we believe we can hear gibbons calling in the distance.\nOur hut\nView from the balcony\nOur hut on the right\nPathway to the hut\nIt has a couple of downsides.\nThe reggae bar on-site opens at 5pm and doesn’t shut til the last person leaves which is fine if you like hearing reggae at extreme volumes til 2 in the morning.\nThe hut is maybe a bit too basic. The steps up to the door are overly steep. I thought I was going to keel over backwards when trying to climb up with my backpack on! Also we didn’t notice at first glance but after using the loo and going to wash my hands I realised there was a mirror on the wall but no hand basin. All bucket-filling loo flushing (a lot of places around here have “smooth” loos with no flush – just a bucket and jug) and hand-washing to be done by the same tap. Interesting. Also the wooden floorboards have pretty large gaps in between and there are a number of purpose-made holes in the walls so who knows what could get into the room….\n…later that evening, after spontaneously booking half a day rock-climbing at 9.55pm for tomorrow at 9am we got back to the hut to find a room-mate or two. Simon the Spider the size of my hand and his best-mate Colin the Cockroach were sat just inside the door. Colin ran in one direction as i sprinted in the other down the dark steps to the main path to leave Matt and Simon having a stand-off. Luckily Matt won by promptly sweeping Simon out the door before he had chance to join Colin under the bed. Can’t say I was too impressed and decided there and then to look for other accommodation tomorrow.\nMatt checked over the rest of the room for any other uninvited visitors and we leapt into bed under the mossie net. Matt fell asleep but I read for another hour until my heart stopped pounding out of my chest and I could relax, when I moved to get into my sleepsheet and Colin’s cousin Clive scuttled across the bed and up the mossie net. I started shouting and Matt jumped up half awake and we both tried to get this bloody thing out of the bed but the mossie net was so securely tucked in to keep out invaders it was difficult to get the sneaky guy out of the darn thing! It was like a carry-on film or something. Definitely moving tomorrow.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/01/10/day-107-wednesday-29th-december-railay-thailand/","summary":"Checked out of bland Harmony House at 10:35 and legged it to the main port of Koh Phi Phi nabbing a ticket on the way to catch the 11am ferry to Krabi and “free transfer” to Ao Nang.

Another 2 girls want out as guys have been trying to bash their doors down in the night. Hmm doesn’t bode well. We cannot be arsed to make the trek back down to the pier to complain so wander off for brekkie to wait for our room.\nThe room we end up with isn’t as bad as we thought (although similar to India standards and a lot more money) and the woman on reception is less stressed and more helpful so we feel more relaxed about being here.\nThe beach Ao Lo Dalam is 10mins away and the view is breathtaking. Huge limestone rocks at either end and many beach bars inbetween.\nBefore sunset we hired a kayak and paddled to Monkey Beach and Ao Lo Lana a small beautiful almost deserted beach apart from a few kayakers. Apart from tearing a chunk out of my right foot and dunking my handbag in the sea whilst trying to get the kayak onto the beach it was good fun \u0026amp; very romantic :)\n Ao Lana beach, north Koh Phi Phi Tuesday was cloudy so we decided to walk up to Viewpoint, the highest point on Phi Phi, to look at the, um, views. Halfway up the steep climb the sun came out and it was hot hot hot and I am so unfit. It was worth it though as the views were amazing across Ao Lo Dalam and Ao Ton Sai.\nAt viewpoint 1 there were these amazing butterfly bushes. So many different butterflies fluttering around one bush.\nViewpoint 2\nWe’d read in the LP that you can walk down the other side to Hat Rantee (Rantee beach) so off we trot in our flipflops looking for the route down hill. Finally we find the signs and start down this overgrown steep pathway through the jungle fighting off mossies all the way. We see one couple coming up looking dishevelled and only two guys come down behind us. We’re not surprised with the state of the “path”. After a 30minute slog downhill we finally make it to Hat Rantee and it was worth it. It’s a small isolated beach with no roads and only a few resorts and restaurants.\nWe decided against the trek back up the hill of doom and got a longtail back to the other side of the island just as the rains came.\nOther things we discovered on Ko Phi Phi:\n  Thai Pancakes ( come on there had to be something food-related)\n  What “buckets” are – mini versions of the punch bowls we used to make at uni\n  The sewerage system needs fixing as it reeks\n  Lying on cushions on the beach at night with a beer looking at the stars\n  Competing fire shows\n  The most tattoo shops in the smallest space in the world (and all having a steady flow of customers)\n   Ko Phi Phi is a beautiful place and you can find peace and quiet as we found in Hat Rantee but the main parts are good for holidaymakers who want to drink lots.

The weather was gorgeous and the view of the limestone karsts of Phi Phi appearing in the distance was amazing. Hopped off and hopped onto another ferry to Ko Lanta where a woman was selling ice-creams. Genius idea.\nArrived in Ko Lanta and met off the boat by 2 guys from Fevrier resort who bundled us, another couple and our bags into the back of a pickup truck for the 20min journey to Klong Nin. Ko Lanta is a lot larger than we realised.\nFevrier resort is just across the road from the beach and is mainly wooden bungalows but our room is in a semi-detached concrete bungalow and is very very lush. It is clean, has a tv, fridge, huge bed with the towels laid out in heart shapes with fresh orchids and a veranda with a little table and chairs made from tree stumps and branches. Plus loads of plug sockets! Something many places lack.\n Explored Klong Nin a bit and it’s mainly resorts and restaurants with a few little shops at one end. The beach is gorgeous and has lots of lovely beach bars along it all decorated for christmas. The water is the clearest and warmest we’ve ever been in. It’s bliss.\nChristmas Eve\nBreakfast at Fevrier was included in the room price so couldn’t say no. Eggs, ham, hotdog and salad. The ham was reformed turkey ham cut into triangles the hotdog was one of those boiled ones with the ends snipped into a cross.\nIt’s Christmas Eve so in true last minute style we went and did our christmas shopping for each other. Hired a moped so we could go to the main town and stop off at Long Beach on the way back. It’s another good beach and is much busier but we prefer Hat Klong Nin as the sea is calmer and the beach is wider.\n\n Ate at a BBQ restaurant on the beach called Richeys. This is the chef whom cooked our delicious tiger prawns and ribs.\nHe also gave us a freebie taster of some shellfish. Not sure what it was:\nA guy did a fire show in front of the restaurant and it was pretty impressive until he set fire to himself. Matt continued to take photos as the guy rolled around on the ground and then legged it into the sea to cool off.\nTreated ourselves to a glass of red wine. As it’s Christmas :)\nAnd everywhere chinese lanterns were being set free into the sky so we joined in. Ours shot off towards the restaurant at first and I thought we were going to be responsible for setting fire to the roof but it span back towards the sea and skimmed the water before floating up into the black sky and we could see it flying further and further out to sea until it disappeared completely. The lady said it was lucky for it to float up. It was almost a disaster as many others had been but lucky for us it steered itself out of trouble.\nChristmas Day\nChristmas in Thailand, how weird!\nWe had no tree so the TV table had to suffice. Mine are the red pressies from Matt and Matt’s are the blue pressies from me :)\nFevrier Resort’s Christmas Tree was better\nHomemade bucks fizz and ferrero rocher (pressie from Matt) on the veranda. Does life get any better than this?\nChristmas day sunbathing.\nNo turkey dinner for us today. Instead we had multicoloured lollys on the beach followed by fish \u0026amp; chips and a bottle of Chang at a beachbar.\nThe evening was spent with the folks at Fevrier Resort. They’d laid on a BBQ \u0026amp; buffet and we didn’t have the heart to go anywhere else. Sat next to a holidaying couple from Germany and Lek kept bringing us more and more food. Plus beer and red wine and some birthday cake made for a pleasant evening.\nSpent 40mins trying to get the internet to work and finally got to call mum and skype dad at Jane \u0026amp; Jason’s place and the laptop was passed around everyone including nan \u0026amp; grandad. It was lovely to see everyone on camera after so long.\nBoxing Day\nWhat better way to spend Boxing day than in deckchairs sipping beer.

The taxi dropped us off in Telak Nipah, the most budget bit of the island and we went to our selected B\u0026amp;B to ask for room. Sorry full. Next one. Sorry full. Next one…and so on until we’d exhausted every guest house \u0026amp; hotel in Telak Nipah. Shit. It was Saturday and Pulau Pangkor attracts the locals from the mainland for the weekend. Darn it didn’t think of that did we. Pangkor is a pretty small island, it was dark, and the last ferry back to the mainland had already gone. We had nowhere to stay. We were getting desperate. It must have shown as Matt was offered the sofa in a guy’s office if we couldn’t find anywhere.\nWell we did find somewhere eventually at a large hotel in the next village. So back in a pink minibus we jumped, paid the same amount again to get there and paid 5 times our budget for one night! We didn’t care. It was 10pm and we weren’t keen on the sofa idea. And the room was pretty nice. And breakfast buffet was included which was an interesting affair. It reminded me of a school canteen. Masses of people swarming around making a racket.\nGot another pink taxi back to Telak Nipah, found the cheapest accommodation possible at the chilled out reggae themed Nazri Nipah Camp and hit the beach. A lovely curve of sand with pretty blue water. Shame about the construction going on all along the beach. The local council have decided to build permanent structures for the hawkers to setup in as they think the makeshift corrugated iron and tarpaulin lean-tos further along the beach are unsightly. It’s stupid though because where the stalls are located at the moment doesn’t obscure anyone’s view as there are no hotels or houses opposite them. Where the council are building the new places completely blocks views from all of the beachfront accommodation with names like Seaview that look like they’ve invested a lot of money in their accommodation. Visitors to the area aren’t going to want to pay a premium price for views of concrete buildings. There is also a law that you cannot build within 60feet of the beach but these are directly on the beach. It’s a stupid stupid idea and is surely going to drive tourists away.\n  There were lots of very tame (and/or hungry) hornbills on the island. A family decided to feed this one some crisps: But we found out later they prefer banana as we saw these lined up for feeding time.\n Monday spent all day trying to work out where to go next. The original plan was to work our way north to Penang and Langkawi in Malaysia and over the border by boat to Ko Lipe in Thailand. But we couldn’t find any accommodation in Langkawi or Ko Lipe around Christmas time. Instead decided to spend Christmas in Ko Lanta near Krabi in Thailand. And insanely thought it would make sense to fly to Phuket and get the boat to Ko Lanta. Not sure that is the best idea we’ve come up with but at least we know where we’re spending Xmas now.

It seems like a lot of the old buildings have been replaced with new ones and they even have a monorail! But the newer buildings have been painted with huge murals which make what would be ugly boring blocks of cement part of the scenery.\nSpotted a few of these “little” creatures on the boat trip\nHopped on the Merdeka Taming Sari, a 360 degree revolving platform that moves up a huge pole to give views over the city. Can’t say there was much to see that stood out but it seemed popular and was quite cool going up so high.\nHad lunch in Donald \u0026amp; Lily’s, an LP recommendation (that wasn’t closed down) and tried the Laksa which is chilli soup with seafood. Tasty stuff. I love the fact that everywhere has Christmas decorations up regardless of religion:\nWe got hooked on dim sum \u0026amp; pork balls for breakfast at this place where they bring out a range of dim sum on a huge tray and you pick 4 or 5 dishes there and then. They’re usually filled with pork or shrimp.

Had lunch at a very lush Indonesian restaurant where we fell in love with Beef Penang and I fell for lychee juice made which comes with fresh lychees in the glass. Not sure Matt fell in love with his bright pink strawberry fizzy shake but he had to try it.\nEsme kindly invited us back to their condo which was beautiful with amazing views across the city and a pool which we took a dip in. The first swimming pool so far this trip. We felt weak trying to swim one length.\nTried something called a Durian pancake. I asked what was in the pancake and the woman looked at me weirdly and said “durian”. Ah I see…no idea… As we waited for the pancakes to cook another customer asked us if we’d tried them before because durian is an acquired taste. That worried us. It was strange, almost cheese \u0026amp; onion pasty like but it’s meant to be a fruit we think. It didn’t kill us anyway.\nOn Esme’s advice we then spent sunset with a cocktail / Erdinger on the 71st floor of the New Asia bar in Swiss Belhotel which is the tallest building in Singapore and so has fab views of the city. Only when we got to the front door did we think maybe we should have gone back to get changed into something smarter and dumped the wet swimming gear first. We did feel a bit of a pair of scruffs sat in a swanky bar surrounded by people in business attire or dressed for dinner. But then again we wouldn’t have got there early enough to get the window seat (and for happy hour) so who cares what we look like if we can pay the bill right?\nI strongly recommend the Nutty Professor cocktail. Vodka, gold rum and amaretto served in a martini glass. A ferrero rocher in a glass. Mmmmm….\nSecond place tipped by Esme was Lao Pa Tat, a marketplace near Raffles Place, where piles of satay chicken were being cooked and scoffed at plastic tables \u0026amp; chairs in a cordoned off street. Lao Pa Tat itself is a large hawkers food hall under an ornate metal covered structure. We read that this was originally a marketplace in Glasgow and was shipped to Singapore in the 1800s! We tried a dessert called Mango Milk Ice that is what it says on the tin. Shaved ice with milk and chopped mango and mango juice. It tasted good. Kind of like mini milks.\nMatt in Lao Pa Sat drinking the strongest cup of coffee in the world (with condensed milk)\nSome of the puddings on offer in Singapore (and Malaysia)\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/01/03/day-91-monday-13th-december-singapore/","summary":"Met up with Dulcie’s sister Esme, her husband Gus \u0026amp; 3-month baby Cleo for lunch as they are currently living in Singapore.

And it is so very clean (even the money) and organised. Almost futuristic. People in cars stop for you at zebra crossings. It has a great metro system.\nMatt’s in love with the place and wants to move here!\nThe only downside we have found so far is in the hostel. Our room is next to to the blokes loos so we hear the showers VERY loudly. The lovely wall stencil brightened our day though:\n Ventured to Orchard Road via the very interesting Cathay movie museum with the idea of walking to the Botanical Gardens at the end. About 5km in total. We never got anywhere near the gardens. Orchard Road is a shopaholic’s birthday and christmas rolled into one. Mall after mall with Chanel, Prada, Armani, Tiffanys in every one. We got lost trying to cross the road as we had to use a subway that entered one mall and after weaving through a maze of shop levels, including one with Marks \u0026amp; Spencer, we ended up coming out in another mall across the road on the opposite corner to where we wanted to be.\nThe whole street seemed to be competing to have the loudest xmas music playing \u0026amp; the best OTT xmas decorations. This particular sparkling purple tree was interactive as you could walk inside, put on some 3D specs and marvel at the extra-sparkly silver glitterballs and purple tinsel over head.\n It’s quite an expensive city in general. We managed to find some food halls with reasonable priced dishes and then proceeded to a coffee shop where the coffee cost more than lunch.\nClose to sunset we went to sit on the harbourside where there is the distinctive Raffles skyline of financial skyscrapers, the singapore flyer (similar to the london eye) and the latest addition – the Marina Bay Sands resort – 3 large buildings with a boat-shape structure linking them at the top holding a 150metre swimming pool plus a cinema, a hotel, a casino and a mall with Jimmy Choo, Manolo Blahnik, food courts and skating rink.\nOnce the sun set we listened to some free live jazz and popped to Glutton’s Corner, a large hawkers food place where I tasted the (according to LP) famous oyster omelette. It was an experience. I ate it. May not ever order it again.As part of the New Year celebrations Singapore is releasing 20,000 white balls into the harbourside to create “visual art” bearing wishes of people for the new year.

Specifically asked the guys in reception last night about breakfast before 6am and they said no problem. We’d also checked when hot water was available – 5am til 12pm (stupid – why have it only switched on in the morning? Don’t people shower in the evenings?) Matt went to enquire about the water \u0026amp; breakfast and had to practically stand on the guy in reception to wake him up. Yes hot water, no breakfast til 8am. Great. We waited as late as we could to have showers and still it was freezing. What were we paying so much money for?\nAs a last ditch to try to get something more out of the hotel we thought we’d take the water from the room fridge. But the fridge stank and there were no seals on the bottles.\nAs we left the rip-off Hotel Cowie’s the guy had the balls to ask for a tip “for good luck”. Bugger off!!\nThe route through Mumbai to the airport was mostly beautiful as the sun was rising behind the city skyline as we drove along the coast. There were already lots of runners on the coastal path.\nNearer the airport there were many many makeshift homes along the roadside and under the flyover. People living under pieces of tarpaulin and plastic with all their worldly belongings and babies laying on the ground. Such a contrast from central Mumbai which was very wealthy.\n Talking of wealthy when you go to Mumbai airport you need to take out a loan to buy a coffee. OK so it’s pretty reasonable compared to Heathrow but when a cup of chai normally costs 5 rupees, paying 150 rupees did sting. It was good coffee though :)\nBye Bye India….\n …Hello Singapore\nFab fab fab flight to Singapore. It was our first time on a Qantas flight and it felt luxurious to us. There was on-demand entertainment. So we could watch what we wanted when we wanted. Of course we chose Toy Story 3. I think even Matt had a glisten in his eye at the end. And we’re now addicted to Modern Family. Plus free bar = red wine. First glass (and it was served in a glass) in 3 months and it was so good we had to have two.\n Once we landed it was easy to get to central Singapore on the MRT and we would have been at our hostel a teensy-weensy bit quicker had it not been for me directing us to Boon Reng instead of Little India (I blame the crap Lonely Planet maps inside maps) which meant 2 changes instead of 1 and then realise that we could have instead got off at Bugis which was on the same line as the airport. Doh!\nWell we made it to Footprints Hostel in Little India and it is a decent enough place. No windows but who needs to hear the outside world? The room is compact but it’s cute, is completely furnished in Ikea and has sweet decorative stencils on the wall. This is the first time we’ve shared a bathroom and it seems fine. Boys and girls are separate so no smelliness in the girls showers. It has washing machines and dryers and free wifi and free breakfast and a huge flatscreen tv with big comfy sofas and a sparkly xmas tree in the corner. Home from home :)\n Had dinner \u0026amp; beer for 10SGD at an open air food place called Shing Porridge on the corner of Kitchener Road and Verdun Road. It had anything you could think of to eat with noodles or rice and Tiger beer :) Having to get used to a new currency now. We are used to everything being in rupees so now trying to translate singapore dollars into rupees and pounds.

We had 4 of us in a tiny lift plus our backpacks because 2 guys felt the need to help us to our room! Can’t complain about the location though. It’s about 10mins from Gateway of India and Taj Hotel.\nThe main road near by is full of market stalls selling beautiful jewellery, scarves, sunglasses and clocks. The market stalls further up town near the university weren’t so classy and I can’t even mention some of the “ladies items” they had on display.\nSpent the day doing the walking tour suggested by LP which took us from Gateway of India, past Chhatrrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (Prince of Wales museum) which was a beautiful domed building in large grounds full of palm trees, down to Horniman Circle, a park with a very bizarre fountain which has a crocodile statue at the bottom of it and real ducks plodding on its head. Luckily for Matt that route also took us past an electronics shop called Croma so our bags are now heavier with blank DVDs, an external hard drive and a mini laptop mouse. I think we spent more time in that shop than we did looking at any historical buildings in Mumbai. Once I’d dragged Matt from Croma, we headed past Flora Fountain to the Oval Maidan, a large grass area where at least 5 proper cricket matches were being played.\nLater wandered to the main train station to have a nose at that. Was pretty impressive building but Matt was more impressed with the endless camera shops opposite and the SLR is now slightly heavier with its new UV filter accessory.\nWe were accosted by some business studies students who had to make as much money as possible from their 1 rupee coffee sweet. Matt made them do a proper sales pitch and lucky for them they did well and ended up with 6 rupees :)\nBear in mind Mumbai is 440 sq km and has a population of 16.4 million and who did we bump into on a random street on the way back to the hotel?

When the bus wasn’t moving it was the most comfortable bus in the world. When it was moving you could feel every bump and hear every screech of the brakes and feel every sleeping policeman.\nStill managed to snooze until about 11pm when I woke and thought wonder if we’ll stop for a break soon. Nope. Nada. An hour later still going…an hour more we finally pull up. It’s 1am. As anyone that knows me well will know after 6hours of travel I am in desperate need for a comfort stop. So I leg it off the bus to find we’re parked on the side of a road next to some street vendors and some trees. I look for the public loos. None in sight.

Somehow it is easy for us now to sit on a train for over 7hrs.\nWe were in Sleeper class for the first time and we prefer it to 3A/C. Can’t say what it would be like overnight but during the day it was nice to be able to see the outside world passing by. There are windows and shutters but both can be opened as you like to let in air. OK there are no mod-cons like power plugs but there are plenty of fans and it feels more open and easier to breathe in than the cooped up aircon carriages.\nAs we arrived in Hospet a guy started loitering around us in the train. We thought he was going to clean the train or something but turns out he was a tuk-tuk driver touting for business to Hampi. He must have boarded the train as soon as it started coming into the station. Of course with our usual attitudes of refusing those who harass us we shunned him and headed for another random tuk-tuk who happened to have the slowest vehicle in the country. We were overtaken by everything, goats included I’m sure. Plus the original tuk-tuk salesman who shook his head at us as he flew past.\nHampi was incredible. Not to make it sound childish but it felt like driving into an episode of the Flintstones. The landscape was so different to anything else we’d seen. Huge bulbous rocks balanced on top of one another as though they’d just been placed there by hand and were about to topple off any minute.\nIn amongst these rocks was Hampi town, one long street of traders trying to flog you the usual tat, leading up to a fantastic Hindu temple. The temple had it’s own cow loitering around the altar and as people lit candles, and kissed the altar, they also patted the cow.\nIn an attempt to find a high point to see the sunset from, we wandered in a random direction and ended up luckily at one of the seven sunset points. Surrounded by remains of old temples – rectangular rocks balanced on more rectangular rocks – and surrounded by these magnificent boulders, we sat and watched the sun go down in the distance and the sky turn pink. Pretty magical.\n Monday we planned to wander along the river bank to the main Vitthala temple but instead hired a moped and drove out to the temple instead. It was amazing. Lots of various carvings in the stone pillars. The place was practically deserted though. Strange for a World Heritage site.\nBack on the moped went to more temples and ruins at the Royal Enclosure and Hazararama Temple.\n The Lotus Mahal and the Elephant stables were favourites of ours. Although how an elephant could have been comfortable in one of those rooms is beyond us.\nMatt asked for a photo of a group of girls who kindly obliged and we must send them a copy:\nLater wandered to the end of Hampi Bazaar past makeshift homes within the old temple ruins to the gorilla shrine which ironically was covered in macaques. There were signs everywhere saying do not desecrate the ruins and at the end was the police station built inside the ruins with potted plants in the front garden. Very quaint.\n I finally got my Indian Head Massage. It looked like a professional outfit from the signs outside. Inside I was pretty much sat in someone’s front room. TV in one corner with the son eating his thali and a massage table along the wall with a curtain divider and the kitchen next door. As I was just having a head massage I got to sit in one of those world-wide popular garden plastic chairs.\nApart from being able to hear the tv, which went off after 10 mins due to a powercut (there is a god!), it was a good experience. The woman used coconut oil which I love and she was a lot rougher than I am when I do IHM. It was more invigorating than relaxing but definitely felt good. At one point it felt as though she was pulling my hair out of my scalp. And twisting the back of my neck my spine might snap. But I came out alive the other end and smiling and it didn’t matter it was in her front room. It was all part of the experience and normal for India. And when I gave her the money (about £3) she blessed it and had a very genuine smile.\nHampi is a fascinating place. But unless you’re climbing or doing yoga for a while there is not much else there (apart from ruins). The temples and landscape have the wow factor but if you’re looking for somewhere to chill for a few days I think Pushkar wins in that respect.\nLatest fellow traveller spotted: Dave from Darjeeling walking down Hampi Bazaar.\nLatest bodge job: Vicky’s Guesthouse, hot shower:\nAh yes we went back to Margao on a sleeper bus. Well we couldn’t believe our luck. It must have been brand new. It was a coach with 2 storeys of sleeping compartments, singles on one side and doubles on the other. We had a double with a sliding door to shut ourselves in and it plenty of room to lie down or sit up. We thought we’d get a great night’s sleep and wake up refreshed in Margao….\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/01/03/day-83-84-sunday-5th-monday-6th-december-hampi/","summary":"Left Goa at 7.30am and arrived Hospet at 3ish.

Hearing xmas carols makes me a little homesick. Especially in this heat! As well as veggies managed to acquire laughing cow cheese triangles and bread rolls for random sarnie making.\nSaw Anita again for her boiling pot. As it is St Francis day today everything closed early so she was minutes away from closing up for the day. Lovely as she is she still said she’s do the veggies so I stopped to help chop them up (the first bit of “home-cooking” I’ve done in a long time).

She came in frequently to chat to us about everything she could think of regarding Indian culture and Western culture. Apart from wanting to know what religion we are (and being shocked at the answer – a question we’ve been asked a number of times whilst in India and the answer usually stops all conversation), here are some of her views which were quite an eye-opener to us. Mainly because Rupa is from a younger generation than us – she was 20 years old at most and things that we just don’t see any issue with in our culture are huge dilemmas for her.\n She wants to marry a foreigner but doesn’t think they would like her because of her skin colour. Marriage between people of different race seemed alien to her. She was really surprised we know couples of all different backgrounds with different skin colour. Yet because she wants to marry a foreigner because she doesn’t like Indian boys as they go after foreign girls in short dresses. She thinks western guys are more loyal and trustworthy. Hmmmm…  Marriage and divorce – you marry once and live with an understanding forever regardless of what happens. Divorce is frowned upon and she was disgusted we know divorced people.   Living with each other before marriage and not with parents . Surprised we lived so far apart from each other and not in same house as our parents.\n She would like to work in the UK or America but passports are expensive (2000 rupee which is almost a year’s wages) and she would not get permission from parents to go outside India. If she was male it would be different.She also kept going on about us getting married and when we get married in India next year she wants an invite :)  I have her address so although she may not be a guest at our never happening wedding at least I can keep in touch with her and see how she’s getting on finding her dream guy.\nMatt’s favourite nurse\n      ","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2011/01/03/day-81-friday-3rd-december-margao/","summary":"Still in hospital but this is definitely the last night and we’re out of here tomorrow morning.

Matt completely lost his appetite and by the time we arrived in Goa he was feeling sick and everything else all over again. We checked into Margao Residency (with hot water!) and both slept for a few hours (neither of us had much sleep on the train). By 5pm he was in such a state I made him see a doctor. Fortunately Margao is a large town so there were a number of doctors within spitting distance of our hotel. We traipsed around for 20mins not actually finding one in their office until down a side alley we found one with a receptionist who called the doctor to speak to Matt about his symptoms and said he’d be back in 10-20mins (India time). 40mins later he turned up and 10mins after that we were traipsing off to the hospital as Matt has an infection that can’t be treated by tablets. Instead he needs intravenous drugs.\nThe receptionist brought us to the “hospital”, Dr Divakar Lolavekar’s Hospital to be precise, which seems to take up half a floor in an office block above a bank and below “Atul’s clinical lab”. We were greeted by a group of young giggly nurses. Did we want a private room? A/C or non-A/C? We are in a large room with 2 hospital beds, a TV, 2 fans. A/C and attached bathroom. All for 750 per night. Cheaper than Margao Residency. They took his details and I had to sign the form – it was my responsibility to admit him!\nThe hospital\n Matt’s room – 1st floor, above Saraswat Bank sign to right of lamppost\nThe nurses plugged Matt in last night and now 29hrs later he’s still plugged in. Matt asked one nurse are the needles disposable and she replied innocently she didn’t know as she only started that day! Luckily the head nurse confirmed that everything is one use only so put our minds at ease. They’ve got him on metrogyl and saline. Plus injections and some tablet a couple of times a day. We don’t really know what they’re giving him altogether but he’s improving.\nThe patient\nYesterday the doctor said 1-2 days in hospital. Today a nurse said 2-3 days. Both hoping we can check out tomorrow.\nI had to check us out of Margao Residency this morning so beforehand did some trips with all our bags from over to the hospital \u0026amp; washed my hair in hot water for the first time in at least 3 weeks. Then went on the hunt for some food for Matt. He’s allowed to have veggie stuff only and juice. Soup seemed like the perfect solution. Nowhere sells soup. Especially non-spicy stuff to takeaway. I asked all over and the best I came across was packet tomato soup. But you need hot water for that.\nManaged to find a place that did fresh juice at last and the lovely Anita, who owns “Oasis food bar”, when she found out Matt was in the hospital and needed food offered to boil some veg. So off I go to the market to buy proper fresh vegetables. Haven’t done that in a long time! Took them back to Anita and an hour later she’d boiled the whole lot up in a big pot of salted water. She piled half into a large jug and put the rest aside “for later”. It was a feast! To have freshly cooked vegetables without sauces and spices was delicious. Matt hadn’t realised how hungry he was and I have never seen him eat a plate of vegetables so willingly before!\nI’d said to Matt we must pop by and see her when he is better and then who should pop by to visit? Anita and her daughter Brenda (recently married). How sweet is that?!\nSo back I go for a jug refill at dinnertime and Matt is now full of nutritious grub for the first time in 3 months!\nFor all the gripes we have of this country there have now been many instances when we have met people with so much kindness who have helped us and made us feel welcome. I can’t believe how amazing Anita has been. She didn’t know me this morning and she has made us food and we have some of her things and I haven’t paid her anything yet. People are very trusting here. It’s a good quality to have.\nJust as an aside, Anita had been to stay with her sister in Kent for 6 months over the summer and they’d taken her to Margate. She said the water was absolutely freezing and prefers Goa’s beaches. :)\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/12/22/day-79-to-80-wednesday-1st-to-thursday-2nd-december-margao-goa/","summary":"We have spent most of December so far in hospital.

Stayed in Fort Kochin most of the day as our train to Goa wasn’t until 22:30. Braved the post office again to send a couple of parcels. Managed to get it all sewn up neatly and posted in less than 2hrs so not too bad.\nSpent a lot of time chilling in Teapot. I am hooked on black tea and Jasmine tea now. Never thought we’d be drinking tea without milk but it tastes good. I tried their Indian Rarebit which was brown toast with a spicy cheese and vegetable mix on top and grilled. Sounds weird. Looks weird. It was actually really tasty.\nManaged to bum around a couple more hours in Fort Kochin. Another walk past the chinese nets again and I was hit on the back by a dead fish which had been dropped by a crow. Very pleasant. Watched as fishermen used their nets. Tourists weren’t the only spectators. Dozens of crows loitered nearby waiting for their free dinner. As did an eagle which managed graciously and with impeccable timing dive into the net the moment the net left the water and select its dinner. Also spotted a rather large rat amongst the rocks. Even more pleasant. After sunset got the ferry back to Ernakulum and randomly ended up at the International Book Festival. We must have looked very strange wandering around the book stalls looking sweaty with our huge backpacks. Over 50% of the books were in Malayam but there was a good range of fiction in English. The books were similar prices to in the UK. The DVDs on the other hand were a practically free and the seller was so enthusiastic about his world films and top directors we bought four. When Matt said he’d email him his thoughts, the guy chucked in another for free. How sweet!\nCompleted our Kerala journey full circle with a Pizza Hut visit. Unfortunately Matt started to feel ill again. I just thought he didn’t like the fact that I made him eat pasta instead of pizza but I don’t think it’s a good sign. Especially not for a 12hr train journey to Goa.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/12/22/day-78-tuesday-30th-november-fort-kochin/","summary":"Today was a weird one.

We’d meant to go last time we were in Kochi but our written-off Sunday put paid to that. Matt was feeling much better too.\nThe plan was almost scuppered whilst on the way to the ferry. I was feeling a bit queasy so we sat down in the park for a couple of minutes. 2 seconds later a bloke came up to us to try to sell us an eel in a carrier bag – head and tail just poking out the top. Yep that helped me feel better. What he thought we were going to do with it I have no idea. When we declined (me clutching my turning stomach) he then asked if we wanted a photo instead! Of the eel or him, we weren’t sure, but quickly left him and the eel for dust.\nThe car ferry from Fort Kochin to Vypeen Island couldn’t have been easier. We paid our 2 rupees (3p) at the kiosk, walked onto the boat and 5 mins walked off again, jumped on the bus for 40 mins, then a 5 min tuk-tuk ride and we were at this long sandy beach with hardly anyone around.\nOn the ferry\nThe buses have women only sections at the front here so Matt was shooed to the back whilst I stood in front. 4 guys work on the bus. 1. Bus driver. 2. Conductor. 3. Guy at front door ringing bell once to let the 1st guy know he needs to stop the bus when people want to get on/off and ringing it twice to let the 1st guy know to get moving. 4. Guy at the back of the bus with a whistle who blows it whenever a guy wants to get on/off at the back to let the 3rd guy know to ring the bell so the 1st guy knows when to stop/start the bus. Talk about efficient. All the 1st guy needs to do is drive and listen to ringing bells.\nAmazingly, the weather turned from a humid overcast grey, which has hung around for the past week, to blue skies and scorching sunshine as soon as we stepped on the beach. Made a nice change from our usual rain. Ironically it then became too hot that we couldn’t sit on the beach for more than 20mins without shrivelling to prunes so found a lovely beach bar overlooking the sea and had a couple of ice cold Kingfishers. Mmmmm. Not before saving a fish that was flipping and flopping about on the beach a bit too far from the sea and was being eyed up by a pair of crows by hoofing it back into the sea. (We are sure Mr Fish is now safe and well and back with his family).\nCherai Beach is on the west side of a long strip of land which is separated from the rest of Vypeen Island by backwaters. Just before sunset we walked over to the backwaters and were lucky enough to see a local using his Chinese fishing net. Matt set up the SLR for a timelapse and we watched as the guy lowered the net halfway, got into his canoe and adjusted each corner, back out of the canoe and lowered it fully. A little later his friend arrived near where we were standing and he whistled around the corner so the net guy jumped back into his canoe and picked up his friend and they both went to the net to pull it back up together. The sun was almost set by now but we could just make out a couple of small fish being scooped out of the net. Good enough for dinner perhaps.\nMatt checked the timelapse and about halfway through the picture had gone dark. He also missed the sunset on the beach side. (I legged it over to take this quick photo of the locals with their mopeds).\nBut neither things mattered because it was lovely being stood on the banks of the backwaters with no-one else around watching our own personal show of Chinese net fishing. It was such a simple chilled peaceful way to fish.\nThere were no tuk-tuks and a queue so although it was pitch black decided to start walking the 4km to the bus stop. Another couple who had been doing the same managed to flag down a passing tuk-tuk and very kindly stopped and gave us a lift. They were newlyweds from Shimla. We all boarded the next crammed bus (called Santa Claus??!) to Ernakulum when I realised we were meant to be going to the jetty. Doh. Trying to explain that to the conductor whilst the this time mental bus driver who thinks he is a F1 driver accelerates and decelerates and overtakes anything in his way at speeds too extreme for a rickety old bus full of standing passengers whilst music is blaring out of the speakers was no mean feat. Somehow we managed to get out at the right junction and grab yet another tuk-tuk to get to the jetty. Just in time again to walk straight onto the ferry back to Fort Cochin.\nLoving the transport systems over here. They seem completely mad but they work so well and everyone uses them.\nBackwaters behind Cherai beach:\n  ","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/12/22/day-77-monday-29th-november-fort-kochin/","summary":"Finally made it to Cherai Beach on Vypeen Island.

He pointed out every temple and church we passed and slowed down at each one. He did almost get us into one of the Kashmir shops near Fort Cochin.

We honestly did try other places to have a change but they were full or too expensive. The guy here is also a really good bloke.\nFound a gorgeous olde worlde shop on Princess Street called “Indian Industries “. There were so many good things about it. The owners didn’t hassle us, everything had price stickers so we didn’t have to haggle and it was full to the brim with many interesting things we hadn’t seen anywhere else. The owner explained that his father had opened the shop in 1945 – pre-independence and it had been the only shop on the road until 7 years ago. He had seen Fort Kochi change over the years from a sleepy residential place to an extremely touristy town. 25 years ago there were only 2 cars in the neighbourhood. The whole of Princess Street is either souvenir shops or hotels. He can’t see any of the real India left. And he made the same remark as we’d thought – that everyone and their dog has a mobile phone. No matter how poor. The country has been invaded by them.\nWe bought a couple of things for ourselves and left him sat with his mother in their shop and pondering over what used to be. We really felt for him.

Before we’d even had breakfast we had our plans sorted. Volker Schmidt, a guy staying at Palmy Residency, asked us if we’d like to join him on a motor boat he’d hired as it was too big for one person. It made sense as we were going to look into doing a boat trip anyway. We have met lots of people with interesting jobs and Volker’s sounded pretty impressive – director \u0026amp; writer (previously actor) in Berlin and Vienna.\nWe opted for 4 hours drifting around the backwaters of Alleppey. The journey started in the North canal which is extremely p0lluted and smelly but 5 mins West and we were out of the main town and in the beautiful backwaters of coconut palms, banana trees, rice paddies, fishermen, chickens and goats searching for food, small brightly coloured houses and Vodafone adverts. Yes Vodafone signs were everywhere. Vodafone have you no conscience? I’ve not been to Venice can’t imagine floating around on the canals there you are bombarded with adverts for mobile telephony. Because it spoils the natural beauty. Grrrr.\nGripes aside it was a lovely relaxing 4hr trip, even the 3hrs of raindrops on the water added to the chill out effect. It was interesting to see the residents of the backwaters going about their daily business. Washing clothes, washing themselves, paddling canoes and having a ciggie or two, workmen diving for mud to build up the defences along the rice paddies, a church filled with a congregation singing hymns with groups of men loitering outside.\nPlus the ducks. Every so often there would be a swathe of ducks across the water squawking away. (Yes that person is wearing a pink umbrella hat – common in the rice paddies).\nIsla \u0026amp; Neil had recommended taking a houseboat trip for 24hrs and we saw a lot of them whilst on our modest trip. We could see the attraction. They are amazing creations. Floating luxury. Nothing like the canal boats in Britain. At one time there were 6 or 7 coming towards us and we felt like we were going into battle! We saw four guys fixing the roof of another houseboat by hand. Everything is hand-made here. But we couldn’t justify the cost of 5000 rupees so that will have to wait for another day. Here is a local guy in his canoe being towed by a houseboat – they’re monsters of the backwaters.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/12/22/day-73-thursday-25th-november-alleppey/","summary":"Backwater trip today.

Matt on the other hand was almost out cold after drifting off whilst reading and smacking himself squarely on the nose with the e-reader. Another advantage of the good old-fashioned paperback – you can’t knock yourself out with a real book.\nWe had asked Rani to arrange a tuk-tuk at 6:00 as she’d said the ride to the station was 15mins and she’d kindly agreed to make us some breakfast to eat on the train. 5:59 we where downstairs in her dining room. “Sit down sit down” she smiled “5 mins 5 mins”. OK we can wait 5 mins no probs. Maybe 7 mins later her husband is bringing out the pile of food and wrapping it neatly in fake banana leaf. OK cool let’s go. They’re both back in the kitchen pottering about. Then he brings out 2 cups of sweet black tea. So we start trying to down this piping hot drink and Rani is smiling “hot yes”. Mmmm very nice and hot but we really ought to get going. 6.15 he’s got the engine running on his taxi and we’re off (funny tuk-tuk but nevermind). He keeps saying train 6:45, I keep saying no 6:30! Somehow after some shrewd James Bond manoeuvring driving side-by-side with another car for a few minutes and cunningly cutting in front we arrive with a couple of minutes to spare. Turns out the train in 10mins late anyway so our man was more right than we were.\nOur surprise breakfast was a very thick rich sweet doughy pancake filled with warm banana and coconut. It was extremely messy for eating on a train but very tasty. Although even with my sweet tooth we couldn’t finish it. Was good to try it though and made a nice change to Tibetan bread, eggs and garlic potatoes which had been a frequent occurrence in Varkala (not knocking those either).\n Now sat on a terrace in Palmy Residency in Alleppey watching a heron (I think) hanging out with a cow.

I was surprised as it’s popular on the Kerala tourist route. Lots of traffic, feels a little polluted and shop after shop after shop. Majority of which are jewellers. Most are small but there is one huge white building which wouldn’t look out of place on the Vegas strip towering over the teeny shops that line the roads and canals. Maybe the start of things to come?\nWe have eaten in traditional canteen style eateries today with dirt-cheap food. Our dinner @ Hot Kitchen came to 120 rupees (£1.80). We were spending more on a set breakfast each in Varkala.\nNews flash: Matt has bought some new flip flops!

Getting a rickshaw at 6am tomorrow so must remember not to drink so much!\nJust eaten lunch at Rani’s again. This time she was overflowing with guests so we had our own private dining table on one of the verandas. Matt was disappointed not to be eating with Mummy again. I think he wants someone else to talk to other than me. Hence the addiction to literature. Lucky we’re off out with Isla \u0026amp; Neil later to give him some stimulating conversation. We’re both feeling the same really. It’s good to chat to other people and we had that a lot in the rest of India but Kerala is more of a holiday destination rather than backpacking so not so easy to mingle.\nRani laid on another luscious feast. The best mussels I have tasted, spicy small fish which could have been whitebait (she didn’t elaborate on what they were – “it’s fish”), fish curry, red onions in raita, veggies, rice and poppadums. Delish. No spoons this time. We ate it properly with our hands.\nHad my 5th and last yoga class with Santhosh @ Kasi Yoga and could definitely tell the difference. I can actually properly hold my feet now! Aren’t you impressed? I really need to carry it on too. Apparently if I do 15 mins everyday of the “Stand Salute” or 1 hour of postures 4 to 5 times a week I’ll be super bendy in no time.\nWhilst I was yoga-ing, Matt was out taking photos and papped the lady shopkeeper whom we passed everyday and persistently asked me to look in her shop and try things on and buy which I did and did and did on about the 4th day. After that she didn’t try to sell me anything again but would say hi every time we passed and have a chat about what we were up to. Then today she had bought in new stock and she wanted me to look but we had no time so unfortunately I didn’t get chance. But Matt has promised to send her the photos of her so I hope she’ll be pleased with those.\nMet up with Neil \u0026amp; Isla for cocktails and food. It was Matt’s turn to eat an insane reproduction of a continental dish. This time the Risotto. Seafood pasta sauce and a spoonful of basmati rice on top. Interesting combination. It was edible at least though unlike the aubergine gratin in Jodphur. The four of us are heading in similar directions again – Hampi \u0026amp; Goa – so we’re sure to cross paths again.\n I have just realised we have been away for 10 weeks now. Where does the time go?

Today it has lost the battle. It is 13:30 and the sky is full. No sunbathing today. It’s warm and dry on our balcony so no complaining. Matt can read (he’s hooked now) and I can blog and bore everyone to death.\nSince Wednesday I can’t say that we have done much at all. We managed a day on the beach when it was absolutely boiling. Matt resisted a sun umbrella as long as possible until he was burnt on the shoulders, then literally 5 mins later the clouds rolled in and 20 mins later it was raining again! Whilst swimming in the sea Matt thought he was picking up some rubbish and realised it was half a dead eel which then managed to find it’s way onto the beach and lie there looking gormless at us for the rest of the day. The other half turned up a little later further down the beach. Why it was torn in half I don’t want to know. Could have been these birds as they seem to like eating anything they can get their beaks into.\nI have started yoga. The first real attempt at exercise in 2 months. So far I have been to three 90min classes in as many days and feeling pretty good for it. It’s on a rooftop covered with a bamboo and palm tree shelter and taught by Santhosh (Kasi Yoga), who looks very much like what I’d imagine a yoga teacher to look like. Long hair, goatee, lots of beads. It’s different to yoga I have done in classes at home (although that was 8 years ago so my memory is pretty faded) in that the stretches last for minutes and the relaxation/meditation periods in betweens stretches can last as long as 5mins. It sometimes feels a little disconcerting (especially if there’s a powercut) sitting/lying there with your eyes closed for such a long time with no sounds. You wonder if everyone else is still there. Another difference is that Santhosh will deeply massage your back to help the muscles stretch and he knew I had a lower back problem straightaway. So hoping that the yoga and massage is helping rather than hindering that. It’s giving me time to chill out for a while each day and giving Matt some peace \u0026amp; quiet for 90mins :)\nWe spent all of Saturday in the Chillout Lounge as they have free wifi trying to sort out our route from here to Mumbai. Once we’d had our mixed up breakfasts (our eggs were on each other’s plates and my “spjnach sauce” which was part of the special breakfast was non-existent), it took us 6 hours and lots of compromise. At first we wanted to see if we could change our flight out of Mumbai to Singapore to an earlier date as we hadn’t planned to spend 3 months in India (it only turned out that way because we didn’t go to Nepal due to the visa issue) and we’d like to spend more time in South East Asia. To do this we had to be able to get to Mumbai earlier. The flights from Kochi looked like they were £25 but when it came to booking they went up to £150. Plan A was abandoned.\nMatt @ Chillout LoungePlan B – to go to Hampi near Goa and the Ajanta and Ellory caves near Aurangabad. Kirsten \u0026amp; Nick had recommended them highly as had Sam. Unfortunately trying to get trains anywhere at the moment in the right order is the biggest challenge. After much deliberation and ranting at Cleartrip we settled on Hampi only. We’ll be in Kerala til the 30th and then Goa/Hampi until 8th and then Singapore here we come! (Can’t wait to hear stories from Ben \u0026amp; Dulcie who are there at the moment, lucky things!)\nOurKaren’s (minor correction needed there –Matt) highlight of the day was hearing Last Christmas by Wham followed by Mad World. Both excellent xmas songs but it doesn’t feel xmassy here at all. Although Golledge insists xmas is nowhere to be seen at home as it’s only November (or Movember – have seen lots of guys with the dodgiest looking tashes) my mum \u0026amp; Wendy are off xmas shopping in London today. And it’s apparently cold and miserable there so I guess it must be just around the corner.\nMustn’t forget my 3rd grey-hair related comment of the trip so far. We were headed back from the main beach past numerous shops with people saying the usual, “You want t-shirt/dress/bedsheet…Come look in my shop…I give you good price, etc etc” when a young boy sat outside one shop came out with something completely different. “How old are you madam?”, he asked innocently, “ your face is young but your hair is old”. Hmmmm pass the henna….\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/26/days-66-to-69-thursday-18th-to-sunday-21st-november-varkala-kerala/","summary":"It’s 21st November – Happy Birthday Ali!\nSat on our balcony at Mummy Bamboo House listening to the rain fall steadily through the palm trees onto the dirt tracks below and forming murky orange rivers.

She thought it looked like drugs as it’s all wrapped in white muslin. It only took 3 weeks so that’s pretty good. I think it has beaten most of the postcards which seem to have been lost in the post.\n Tuesday morning joined the hardened commuters on the 5:50 train from Kochi and by 10:00 we were at Mummy Bamboo House in Varkala about a minute’s walk from the North Cliff edge overlooking the Indian Ocean.\nRani at Mummy Bamboo House is lovely. Straightaway she was making us tea and later that day a traditional Keralan lunch of fish curry, rice and three different types of spiced vegetables all freshly cooked by Rani and served in a thali tin. We met “Mummy”, a writer, who lives up the road and has been coming to Rani’s for lunch for the past 4 years. She came to India with her daughter 6 years ago and decided to set up home here.\nWe also met Rani’s baby boy being fed by grandma \u0026amp; her 11-year old son. The son seemed extremely resourceful. Mummy wanted a new rolling pin for her chapati so off he went with his dad’s knife to cut some bamboo. And kept cutting it and kept cutting it to make it flat until he cut it too much he had to start again, this time with the saw! He did it in the end. Can you imagine an 11-year old in the UK being given a big knife and saw and make a rolling pin? Amazing. Varkala is a strip of shops, restaurants and ayurvedic massage centres along a cliff top with 3 beaches. It is the most touristy western place we have visited. Everyone is trying to sell you something. It’s a mixture of good points and bad points as all of India seems to be. The good being great food, good accommodation, western loos everywhere! The coastline is beautiful. Beaches and black rocks and palm trees. Eagles flying overhead on the thermals. (And parasailers too). The bad being the hassle and the lack of real India (which makes it more expensive). It’s crazy that we get frustrated by The Real India but being here is such a fake India that we miss The Real India. Although Varkala isn’t fully developed yet. There are still hints of the rest of India. Such as the rubbish strewn down the cliff side. The staring, but that’s mainly the blokes on the beach and they are constantly shooed away by the beach police.\nThere seems to be a rule on Papanasham Beach. No non-westerners. We saw a few Indian guys who were just about to go swimming being whistled at by the police and told to leave. I’m not comfortable with that. There is an issue here that needs to be resolved and to me they’re treating the symptoms not the cause. Why do groups of Indian guys feel it necessary to gawk at bikini-clad women? Well why do any men? It happens all over the world. But perhaps not so obviously. But it’s less subtle here because they’re not used to seeing half naked women. It’s taboo. So why let westerners come here and sunbathe half-naked? Because they bring money to the area. It’s another example of where things are changing here at different rates. So much of Indian culture is similar to our culture over half a century ago. They haven’t had the changes we had in the 60’s and 70’s but in trying to adopt western culture it clashes with their traditional values.\nI don’t think I’ve really made the point I wanted to here but wanted to write it down as thoughts for the future. India will go through more changes, as we saw in the photography exhibition in Kochi it is happening and it will be interesting to think back to little occurrences like this and if they’ve changed.\n Completely changing the subject, we arranged to meet up with Kirsten \u0026amp; Nick for dinner and then bumped into them in a cafe earlier in the day. It was so good to see familiar faces and have a good chinwag. So lucky for us to have been in Kerala at the same time as them. Again a complete coincidence as we had no idea when we would be in this area of India. Had our first cocktails of the trip. It was happy hour at Kerala Coffee House so of course had to oblige. As it was raining it was a good enough excuse to stay and have two. Nick \u0026amp; Kirst were such bad influences :)\nI’d bought a new dress for the occasion as a treat (up until now I’d only had shorts and trousers) so brought out the makeup to feel even more girly. It felt strange putting on blusher and mascara after 2 months of being bare. That had been the longest period without makeup since I started slapping it on as a teenager.\n Wednesday we attempted to go to Black Beach to meet K \u0026amp; N but somehow faffed about so long doing desperately needed washing and who knows what else that we didn’t get anywhere near there til 3pm. By that time K \u0026amp; N were frazzled from a day of sunbathing. When Matt \u0026amp; I finally made it to Black Beach it started to rain just for a change. We persevered and managed to get a few rays before the sun set and went off to meet K \u0026amp; N plus their mate Charlie (who also coincidentally happened to be in Varkala at the same time) for Thai curry \u0026amp; beer. Delicious.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/26/days-64-to-65-tuesday-16th-to-wednesday-17th-november-varkala-kerala/","summary":"Before I forget mum has received the parcel from Darjeeling and it’s in one piece!

They had FOUR towels laid out on the bed without us even asking. And plenty of natural light. And no psycho bloke at the desk.\nWandered to Mantancherry on the other side of the island to Fort Cochin where I could have spent an absolute fortune. So many shops selling gorgeous jewellery, pashminas, cushion covers, ornaments you don’t need etc etc. Managed to avoid buying anything. Later as we were off out for dinner who did we spot checking into our hotel? The New Zealand couple Isla \u0026amp; Neil whom we’d met in Delhi half-checking in then checking out of Smyle Inn and then bumped into in Chowrasta (the main square) in Darjeeling. What are the chances?\nWe went for a beer with them and ended up rolling into our room at about 3 or 4 this morning after far too much beer and rum \u0026amp; coke and no food. Somehow we slept until 2pm when we had to check 3 different clocks to believe it really was that late. Haven’t had a hangover in 2 months and now we both remember why they are BAD! I don’t think our bodies will forgive us for a long time. I’m sure my liver was just starting to repair itself!\nSo Sunday was a write-off and we only managed to get out for lunch briefly at the lovely Kashi Art Cafe with proper fresh tuna \u0026amp; cheese melts \u0026amp; good strong coffee. Felt more human in the evening and after attempting 3 different restaurants that were either closed or not serving dinner we ended up back in Teapot for roast chicken \u0026amp; roast potatoes, Keralan style. The closest we have had to a Sunday roast in a long time.\nMonday we met Isla \u0026amp; Neil for brekkie and then braved the ferry queue, which surprisingly were two orderly ones, a men’s and a women’s. Not sure I’ve mentioned that before. Pretty much all queues are split by gender usually with only one person serving both queues alternately. Again the ladies was shorter so I got to queue in the heat and have the same problem again with 2 and 3. The guy once again thought I asked for 3 tickets. Why would I ask for 3 tickets when it quite blatantly says maximum 2 tickets per person all over the ticket booth? I really need to learn English before I can even think about teaching it!\nThe queuing system evaporated after the ticket booth and it was a free-for-all to get onto the ferry. How my backpack is still in my possession in one piece I’ll never know. I thought my hand was going to get dragged away with it too.\nBack in Ernakulum we headed for Excellency Hotel nearish the station. It looked a bit posh for us but LP had recommended it and we didn’t mind paying a bit extra for one night. I think the receptionist took one look at this sweaty pair of scruffy backpackers and claimed they were full. Well we had that for another hour. Although most of the places were dives they were all full. Seemed a bit fishy to me. I think we were in more of a locals area than touristy place. Eventually found Shalimar Residency, a rip-off at 900 rupees but it was another Pushpak style hotel (Kolkata) and did the job. It had a TV. And was 5 mins walk from Pizza Hut and the station so couldn’t complain.\nNever guess where we had dinner then. Yep another round of pizza \u0026amp; garlic bread. Followed by an hour of traipsing round shoes shops to find the magical pair of sandals that only exist in Matt’s head and no-one has manufactured yet. He must have tried on at least 20 different sandals, flip-flops, slip-ons, leather, plastic, you name it. At one point a shop assistant suggested a pair and Matt asked for something “more masculine”. I believe I have seen many Indian guys wearing that exact style!\nStill Matt’s refusing to budge until he finds his glass slipper and in the meantime is plodding on in a 4-year pair of flip-flops that are thinner than cardboard and probably giving years of back trouble to come. It will be front-page news when he finally gets some. Which will be when the current ones fall apart completely.\nNot sure he’s going to like me for blogging about his footwear issue.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/23/days-61-to-63-saturday-13th-to-monday-15th-november-fort-cochin-kerala/","summary":"Saturday morning legged it from Seashore Residency and ended up in Elite Hotel on the main high street which is much much nicer.

The atmosphere here is completely different. The station was calm. Not too many people. And we found a Pizza Hut. Very sad but after our experiences of pizza in Havelock we needed it. Went to the Women Changing India photography exhibition in Kochi which Matt had spotted in a photography magazine. It was interesting to see how things are changing here. Women training and working in “men’s” jobs such as security guards and setting up an independent bank which lends money to women for small business ventures. It was refreshing to get a view of women working in this way as you hardly see any women in business such as restaurants and hotels. The majority seem to be run by men.\nCaught the ferry to Fort Cochin with ease and we were in the most touristy place we have seen in India. Fort Cochin is not The Real India. It has been westernised and has many souvenir shops, travel agents selling backwater tours and trendy restaurants and cafes. Don’t get me wrong it is an interesting place with beautiful Mediterranean style buildings which were built by the Portuguese and Dutch. Still lots of tuk-tuks though.\nThe homestay we were hoping to stay at was full so our kind tuk-tuk driver took us to another homestay called Seashore Residency. The guy seemed nice enough and the room seemed fine at first glance. Then Matt asked for towels. He was given one and so asked for a second. He was reluctant to give two saying “One room, one towel. Ask anyone, one room, one towel”. Finally he did saying “As you’re a friend, OK”. Hmmm alarm bells started to ring. Then the electric cut out which is really common here so we’re used to it but not when the window opens onto a brick wall so no natural light can get in. Then the hot water we’d perhaps optimistically expected to come out of the shower only came out of the tap. Then the guy started the hard sell on us for the backwater trip and that started to really get our backs up.\nWe went out for tea and cake at the cutest cafe Teapot with tea chests for tables and so many different teapots I loved it! Matt especially loved having his photo taken with lots of them :) (NB We did not eat massive plates of cake. The 2nd photo is from our 2nd visit to Teapot for dinner which I do mention in a later post but felt it made better sense to group the Teapot photos.) and then watched another beautiful sunset behind the Chinese fishing nets.\nCame back to the homestay guy trying to flog us the backwater trip again. We said we’d let him know. And he started following us down the corridor going on and on about how he was a small business and we need to book it through him and then started trying to flog us Kathakali dancing tickets. I couldn’t get the key in the lock fast enough.\nWe later went out for dinner at a lovely place called Shala with Keralan fish curry and beef (yes actual chunks of cow – our first in 2 months) served with pumpkin and cardamom seeds plus a very healthy cucumber mint lemon cooler and freshly pulped thick scrummy pineapple juice. Tried to tip-toe to our room but bumped into the homestay guy who demanded we pay one night’s rent in advance. Fine with us. It meant we could escape as quickly as poss the next day which we made sure we did.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/23/day-60-friday-12th-november-kochi-to-fort-cochin-kerala/","summary":"Left Chennai at 10:45pm and arrived in Kochi at 11:30am Friday.

This was embarrassingly the best one out of four attempts!\nChennai was a bit of a disaster. Started off OK. Managed to get the train from the airport to the central train station successfully for the cost of a cup of chai. Had 7hrs to kill til our train so trundled off to left luggage where they refused at first to take it as we had no padlocks on our bags. Firstly how is it possible to padlock a backpack and secondly what’s the bloody point of leaving it in left luggage if they can’t trust their own employees not to steal from unlocked bags. Matt argued with them until they agreed to take them but after 20mins we were back there taking them back. We felt it was asking for our stuff to be tampered with. This meant we had to carry the darn things with us. That set me off in a bad mood and at that point I really wanted to leave India. It was doing my head in. I know it sounds like a trivial thing but this country can really make you go through a rollercoaster of emotions.\nCalmed down and wandered off to George Town as the LP book made it sound interesting. All we could see were metal shop after metal shop after metal shop making or selling anything you could desire made of…metal. Except for one road which was nothing but dental clinics. There were many people lying in the streets in rags.\nThen between Chennai Central and George Town amongst the chaos was this rather grand and beautiful building. Can you guess what it might be?

Matt in the hammock hiding from the sun and me in as much sun as poss. Had bar-b-q fish again for dinner at Pellicon. This time we had the biggest chunk of tuna fillet I’ve ever seen and a delicious Silverfish marinated in tandoori sauce. Delish.\nTuesday we decided to get up for sunrise. Alarm set for 5am, we dragged ourselves out at 5.15. Mr Sun was already half up but it was still pretty. The tide was out which reveals lots of old coral rocks and leaves lots of sealife behind like bigger rock-camouflaged crabs and teeny blue fishes swimming through the coral tunnels.\nHired a moped and headed to the jetty to buy ferry tickets for Wednesday. Matt offered to “queue” whilst I sat and alternated between watching him get elbowed out the way by 80-year old women and watching two kids (baby goats) skipping around trying not to get run over by rickshaws whilst eating anything they could get their teeth into.\nWent on a bit of a joyride towards the south of the island and found the elephant training camp which was deserted apart from one guy in a hut whose only words were “Don’t come back”. We didn’t realise at the time that the elephants are trained for logging and later two went stomping down the road as we were sat at a cafe covered in logging chains with men shouting at them continuously. It was terrible really and we’re glad we hadn’t seen any at the training camp.\nIn the evening we went back to Radha Nagar beach (beach no. 7) and kind of watched the sun set behind clouds. An effigy from the recent festival was sat on the beach without a head. So Matt felt obliged….\nThe beaches here are covered in hermit crabs of all sizes plus small white crabs that are almost invisible and can move extremely quickly. I have a video of one moving in and out of it’s home in the sand. Unfortunately videos are a pain to upload on here so will have to put in on YouTube. Instead here’s a photo of the patterns they make on the sand:\nAnd here’s a hermit crab:\n Talking of videos we have a great one of the moped trip. Will have to remember to upload that one too sometime.\nOur last night in the hut on Havelock and had a lovely surprise when I popped to the bathroom at 2am. I usually take a few seconds to survey the bathroom to check for cockroaches so you can imagine my pleasure at spotting a snake slithering around the floor by the loo. I thought I was going to have a heart attack! Fortunately our bathroom is quite long and the door is at the opposite end to the loo so didn’t get too close to it, shot out, slammed the door shut and shouted for my knight in white shining armour to save me. Matt clambered sleepily out of bed and apparently his first thought was where’s my camera? But as I was in such a state he bravely went to investigate minus the camera whilst I flitted around babbling about the possibilities it could be hiding behind the loo and be ready to jump out at any moment. But the rascal had fled the scene so was probably more scared of me than I was of it. Who knows what we’d have done if it had still been there though. Anyone know how to catch a snake? Matt probably would have been setting the ISO on his 7D in an instant.\nI’m glad that it occurred on our last night and not our first otherwise I’m not sure I could have stayed in that hut for 11 more nights. Matt had often used the bathroom in the middle of the night and not switched on the light so as not to disturb me. Wonder what creatures could have been lurking in there then…\n More sunbathing Wednesday and as we looked at the clear turquoise sea with other islands on the horizon we realised we could have easily spent a few more days doing absolutely nothing on the beach and maybe another day of diving. But good to leave on a high and we know we want to see much more of the world too.\nSo back to Port Blair we went on our ferry sat in “seat” class this time. Which was cheaper and comfy enough. We just had more people to stare at us or not very subtly try to take our photos. As we were the only westerners in the room. But we’re getting used to the stares. Even those when you look up and they keep staring.\nManaged to get back into Aashiaanaa Guest House and found the LP recommended restaurant Lighthouse Residency for dinner. We felt like we were in a Fawlty Towers episode. All the waiters wore black waistcoats and bowties like Manuel. And we had about 4 guys trying to take our food \u0026amp; drinks order at different times. We’d order from one, another would come and ask us what we wanted to drink and we’d try and explain that we’d already ordered but he didn’t understand and tried taking our order again. Then they didn’t have what I wanted so I had to choose again and then a 3rd guy came and tried to take our order again and trying to explain when the others had once again disappeared was hysterical. That makes no sense whatsover and doesn’t sound funny at all does it. Guess you had to be there.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/18/days-56-to-58-monday-8th-to-wednesday-10th-november-havelock-island-port-blair/","summary":"Sun is shining yay!\nSpent most of Monday on our lovely little bit of secluded beach.

It’s the Diwali festival of lights today. Such a shame it’s hardly stopped raining. We have been in the hut most of the day. I ventured to the beach to do a quick weather check earlier today only to see the storm coming once again across the sea towards me and by the time I’d run the 100m back to the hut I was drenched! We’ve heard the edge of a cyclone is hitting the island and it’s expected to stay for another few days. Just our luck! I’m glad we had a few days of sun. We met a couple at dinner who arrived on Tuesday and have had rain everyday. Ferries were cancelled for some of Wednesday and all of Thursday due to rough seas. They’d heard from a guy who arrived on the last ferry that only about 5% of the passengers managed to survive without being sick. Ugh.\nOoh Ooh we passed our PADI Open Water Diving certification. Whoop! We have our names down for diving again Sunday if the weather gets better and Matt’s shotgunned the underwater camera :)\nHaven’t mentioned food much lately have I? Well as Havelock is pretty small there isn’t an abundance of restaurants and it’s been dark and rainy so we have been rotating in a triangular formation between Eldorado for basic noodles, paratha and puri, Anju-coco-resto across the road with good fish \u0026amp; prawns and Full Moon cafe, which admittedly I have mentioned but not enough. We had very good west indian fish curry and the scrummiest warm apple \u0026amp; cinnamon muffin today. I could have kissed the woman. I have been praying for good cake since leaving Darjeeling’s Cake Lady and it was delivered! We tried to venture outside of our safety net this evening even though we risked getting wet and run over (no streetlights here and crazy moped \u0026amp; jeep drivers who only use their headlights sporadically) but failed miserably. First we headed to “World’s best pizza – cheap price” as we are desperate for pizza. On receipt of the menu it looked surprisingly similar to all the other places round here. Curry, chapati, pakora, etc etc. In one corner under “Veg dishes” one line said Pizza 100 rupees. Interesting we thought for a pizza place with such high claims of being the best in the world. On enquiring what pizza they had the guy innocently answered “one flavour of tomato sauce”. Of course, had to be tomato sauce. Because they have that with everything here. I thought Wendy ate a lot of ketchup but in India it’s served with anything you order. That and green chilli sauce which I love. Anyway we decided to leave as it had severely scarred us. The only other couple in the restaurant said they’d found the name a little misleading too but had been too lazy to leave once they’d got there! This place is honestly losing out. If they were serving pizza, they’d make a killing. It doesn’t have to be the world’s best. Just any pizza with topping will be better than none when you’re claiming to be a pizza restaurant.\nWe wandered 15mins in the other direction to Sunrise Resort which we’d heard had OK food and was the busiest bar in the restaurant. Right. Any night except tonight yeah. Unless you call one old hippy sat alone staring out towards the trees a buzzing bar. I’m sure he’d been sat there in the exact same place when we’d checked out the accommodation last Friday lunchtime. Hope he’s still breathing.\nSo back to trusty Anju-coco we trotted for delicious fish special with garlic bread. Plus a special Diwali festival dish of rice pudding with cardamom. They’re not big on their puddings in India. Cake Lady needs to branch out!\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/15/day-53-friday-5th-november-havelock-island/","summary":"Happy Anniversary to Steve \u0026amp; Anne-Marie!\nIt’s bonfire night in the UK and you’d be forgiven for thinking they have the same tradition over here as kids are running round with sparklers and setting off fireworks and the loudest firecrackers I’ve ever heard giving this old woman many mini heart attacks.

We were under no illusion that we’d get that ferry when we landed. But the information desk woman at the airport plus the taxi driver assured us we could make it. At 13:58 we were running across the jetty towards the 14:00 ferry laden down with backpacks waving at a large ferry in the dock. They were just about to leave. As we got to the door (knackered) the guys asked for our ticket. Hmmm didn’t have one of those. So no ferry til next morning at 6am. I was pretty peed off as we’d run for it and there was no way we could have got that ferry. Especially now knowing that it takes at least 45mins to get tickets due to the once again faff of a system of getting forms off one guy who only hands them out when he feels like it, deciphering what needs to be filled in, then queuing forever whilst the staff take hours to do the one and only job they need to do. Book a ferry ticket.\nWe spent one night in Port Blair in a nice guest house called Aashiaanaa, had dinner with a couple of Aussies Karim \u0026amp; Annie and got our 9am ferry to Havelock with no problems. So it worked out well in the end. And we had great seats. We went for “chair” class as had no idea what anything was. As we boarded we were ushered past everyone else going into the main cabin, into a side cabin where there were 7 comfy chairs like on a plane with aircon and one porthole. There were 3 other people apart from us so we felt pretty posh. Very bizarre.\n In Havelock we have a 8ft x 10ft hut consisting of a double bed with mosquito net, a sideboard, a ceiling fan, a lean-to ensuite at the back (painted pink) and a porch at the front. One lattice window, no glass. Plus one door, painted pink. Both window and door are adorned with green Disney-motif curtains – not-quite-the-real-McCoy Mickey Mouse and Donald Ducks cover them.\nThe hut is less than 100m from a small sandy beach and the blue blue sea. Lush.\nFirst few days, bought a hammock, found 2 trees on the beach, laid and read in said hammock with calm relaxing waves in the background.\nHired a moped, neither of us had been on one before. Matt being main driver, me back-seat driver made our way along 12km of dimpley bumpy roads surrounded by rice paddies and jungle across to the North West side of the island to Radha Nagar beach to watch the sun set. The return journey was more interesting with it being pitch black and raining. Made it back alive.\nStarted a PADI Open Water diving course on Tuesday with Dive India and did our first ever dive on Wednesday. Neither of us ever yearned for diving but as we were on an island with good diving we thought we’d give it a go. How do the American’s say it? Awesome.\nOn our 2nd dive we saw a turtle. A real-life sea turtle (a hawskbill) which was about half the size of me. Wow. Plus Nemo and his babies popped out of some sea anemones. The Longfin Bannerfish were also a favourite of mine. Also saw shoals of baby barracuda (we’d eaten a barbequed adult barracuda for our dinner the night before).\nToday we had our 3rd and 4th dives which included a 4-year old shipwreck. Eerie but very cool. So many fish inside just bobbing side to side like some kind of ritualistic dancing. The best dive was the last one along the side of what was called “The Wall” which is a huge reef that drops down almost vertically about 55metres. We went down to 18m. There were so many shoals of different fish of all sizes. A lionfish covered with tentacles, large parrotfish with huge foreheads, an electric clam sparking away in it’s cubby-hole, a huge thick moray eel entangled in the reef where you could see glimpses of its long grey body and its head just poking out with it’s beavis and butthead jaw moving slowly up and down.\nWe couldn’t believe that so much life is going on just below the surface of the ocean. It’s fantastic. And whilst above water the winds were blowing and the current was strong, below the visibility was still good and it felt like another world. Very dream-like.\nFingers-crossed we pass the exam tomorrow so we’ll be qualified and so Matt can take a camera down and start snapping. He spotted their G10 in its underwater casing earlier and now can’t wait to get his hands on it and get into some underwater photography.\nI just want to get back to the Full Moon cafe next to Dive India so we can have more roast chicken and excellent mashed potato. That’s the closest taste to home we’ve had since being in India. Plus homemade lemonade with fresh mint. Yum. The place is a really lovely chilled out place which I think it has something to do with the New Zealand girl who manages it. So many restaurants and hotels etc in India are run by men only and they just don’t get how a few nice touches here and there make a place so much more. Like all food being served on a banana leaf on a plate. It’s a lovely idea.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/15/days-45-to-52-thursday-28th-october-to-thursday-4th-november-andaman-islands/","summary":"For the past week we have been in the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea on the tropical Havelock Island.\nWe landed in Port Blair on South Andaman Thursday afternoon and jumped in a taxi 15 mins before the last ferry was due to leave for Havelock.

Somehow Uli, the German trainee architect who is studying in Vienna, had wangled us a lift to our hotel with a lovely Kolkatan couple whose driver met them at the station in their new Jeep wagon thing that had room for a family of 10 and still had the bubble wrap on the spare wheel. They were happy to go out of their way to take us to central Kolkata before they went to their home in South Kolkata as it was gone 1am and they knew the taxis would rip us off. Uli has also managed to wangle himself a free chicken sandwich which the driver picked up from Subway on his way to the station.\nHotel Pushpak was a dated business hotel with a grand front entrance with marble floors and comfy sofas. I could hardly say “mineral water” I was so tired – it took 5 attempts for the guy to understand me – must be my accent. But he expected us to fill in forms about our names and addresses and other complicated information like that. Unfortunately there were no other spare rooms so Uli was led out into the night to another more expensive hotel nearby. We never saw him again so I hope it worked out OK wherever you ended up Uli. We feel bad for getting your lift to our hotel and you had to go find somewhere else to stay. Sorry Uli!!\nWe had the creepiest guy take us to our room. He looked like an Indian Lurch. Too tall and gangly so he kind of swayed over like a palm tree. He walked ahead into our room, turned the TV on and then went to leave, changed his mind, over to the A/C machine, turned that on, back to the doorway, switched on the bathroom lights, loitered a bit more. I was thinking he’s after a tip here. It’s friggin’ 1:30am and we’re like zombies and Frankenstein wants us to think about tipping him for showing us how the TV works. He grew impatient and grinning said “you can tip if you like?”, cheeky git. Matt gave him a tenner (14p) and he grinned even more. As he backed out of the room slowly he kept saying “room service 502, OK? anything you want 502 OK?” about 5 times. It felt like a lifetime had passed when he finally left and we could bolt the door before he wandered back in.\nThe fan in our room had somehow managed to work its way across the ceiling:\nDoes anyone know why even if you’re really knackered and need to sleep you still become hypnotised by TV? We’d become hooked on VH1. “Oh is this more like MTV now playing new music? Didn’t they used to play old people music when we were younger?”, Matt says. Then realises the Foo Fighters and Green Day songs they’re playing are from the nineties and are for old people.\n Sorry just realised I said about 3hrs ago how good Kolkata is and haven’t even got through the night yet.\nIn brief, Kolkata was less hectic, less annoying as there were fewer tuk-tuks and so many yellow taxis on decent roads with traffic lights you could have thought you were in New York. There is a large green(ish) space which reminded me of the downs and it was easy to find our way to the main Park St area with shopping centres and restaurants. Perhaps Delhi could have been a more similar experience if we’d let it but we found it difficult to navigate and the heat was unbearable.\nAs we only had one proper day in Kolkata we got our backsides in gear and did 4 touristy things:\n Victoria Memorial  This place is MASSIVE. It’s a huge white building which was started in 1901 for Queen Victoria (Empress of India) when she was alive and finished 20years later, 20 years after she died. It has large marble domes with stained glass and is set in enormous grounds with a statue of the lady herself sat on a throne in the front. You could easily pick it up and put it in Surrey and it wouldn’t look out of place. It did in India. British monarchs were so pompous.\nWe were just heading towards the gates when an Indian family asked if they could take a photo. No problem we said. Suddenly a small child was thrust into Matt’s arms and we were suddenly part of a family portrait. How trusting they were to give a random bloke their child. Especially one with little experience of holding kids!\n Indian Museum  Another colonial type building with a cool courtyard and lots of Buddhist and Hindu statues which were cool. The very last thing we saw as it was closing were pickled embryos of different mammals. This included 2 human embryos, one full term. Weird.\nPlanetarium  Even weirder was this place. We arrived early to avoid the queues and was glad we did as the line of people went out the gate. Except that the line only had about 40 people in it and the planetarium, being one of the largest in the world, swallowed us all up easily so that you hardly noticed anyone else there. Except for the crying baby. But we only noticed that so well because the “narrator” lady would stop speaking mid-sentence every time the baby cried. And the parents would muffle it until it stopped crying perhaps due to lack of oxygen whilst being smothered.\nThe planetarium was an impressive building. Shame about the presentation. It was like a cross between a bad 70’s sci-fi show and being in an extremely boring science class with the teacher not being able to use the OHP properly and she’s forgotten her glasses so everything starts off in focus but immediately switch out of focus. And/or leave another sheet on top of the OHP blocking out half of Jupiter. She could see well enough to tell off the guy with his mobile phone switched on though.\nMcDonalds  Our first of the trip. Of course no beef in India so the menu consisted of chicken burgers, chicken nuggets and veggie burgers. There had to be an equivalent Big Mac of course – the Chicken Maharaja Mac. Hmmmm I’ve tasted more chicken in a big mac at home but it had to be done.\nAnd that was about that for Kolkata. We left early Thursday morning to get to the airport in plenty of time. Not before the Pushpak guy asked for more tips sir. What the hell for? You were asleep on a mattress when we came downstairs. Yeah ok you got us a taxi but there were quite a few outside the front door so guessing we could have managed that by ourselves. What a load of @!*$!\nWe did honestly like Kolkata though really.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/15/day-44-wednesday-27th-october-kolkata/","summary":"Kolkata (previously known as Calcutta although may still be known as Calcutta as many people still say they’re from Bombay even though its now Mumbai – must check this out) was a pleasant surprise for a large city.\nWe arrived late Tuesday night as our train took 2hrs longer than it needed to.

Khangchendzonga is clearly visible on above the skyline. It’s beautiful.\nWe stopped at our regular egg roll lady and acquired two on the way to Observatory Hill North East of centre to sit and admire the view of the mountain. Not quite as impressive a view as the one from Sandakphu but still not bad.\nStopped for tea tasting where the guy let us smell about 20 different samples of tea which he warmed in his palms first to release the aroma. We then tried 2 types with more Cake Lady cake!\nBraved the post office. To send a parcel from India it has to be wrapped in white muslin and sealed with wax. So we collected together everything we wanted to send into one bundle and took it to a material shop where an old bloke took a piece of scrap muslin, sewed it into the shape of our parcel, put the parcel inside and then sewed it shut with thick cotton. Anther guy then took out a bar of red wax and a seal and like in the olden days when all letters were sealed with wax, he carefully blobbed wax along the seams and pressed the seal down to fix it. Fascinating. We trotted off to the post office, filled in the customs forms in quadruplicate, wrote the address on the muslin and sent it off into the Indian postal system. Which apparently is more reliable than the British one. We read a newspaper cutting in one shop from a few years back that claimed people from the UK holidaying in India around November/December time would bring their Christmas cards with them and post them. Must say it seems cheaper to send a letter from India than UK. And it was only 12 rupees for a postcard (15p).\nLove Darjeeling. Will yet again be a shame to leave it. But will be good to get to some warmer climes again.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/15/day-42-monday-25th-october-darjeeling/","summary":"Last day in Darjeeling and weather today is lovely.

What better time to do it than whilst Matt has his first shave in 6 weeks. I could be writing a novel here :)\nShort version:\nThe trek was amazing. There were bad points, there always are with us two. But the result at the end was phenomenal. The views at sunrise across the Himalaya mountain range spectacular, breathtaking.\nFrom Sandakphu, 3600m high, we could see a looming Khangchendzonga (Kanchenjunga) (8598m – correction from earlier post – this is the 2nd highest in Himalaya, 3rd highest in the world after Everest and K2), the Three Sisters, Makalu and the tip of Mt Everest. Wow. Worth every drop of rain and every metre climbed and every aching limb coming back down.\nLong version:\nDay 1 – legged it to the trekking place arriving at 7.10am as taxi was due between 7 and 7.30. Sat there til just gone 8 and as the Jeep pulled up I realised I still had the hotel key in my pocket. Doh. Stupid cow. We called the hotel and arranged for them to pick it up from the trekking office – yes they knew the one – next to the Pizza place, right? It’s good to know we’re not the only ones who navigate by food related places.\nMet lovely Basque country couple Arancha and Felix who were going to have to put up with us two for the next 5 days. I think they did just about.\nJeep man took us to Mane Bhajang (2134m) near the Nepalese border and dropped us off for lovely porridge with fresh coconut and veg momos at some woman’s kitchen where her kids were playing an unusual table game with numbered discs shooting them into 4 corner pockets. Our guide turned up at that point and whisked us off up the steepest hill ever in the hottest heat ever! I was not prepared. I haven’t done any exercise since Fitball 6 weeks ago and I was knackered walking around Darjeeling. That aside it was good to burn some calories and I thought after 4 days of this I’ll be leaner \u0026amp; fitter :)\nAfter a short while the views became obscured by thick cloud and the mist descended but it was nice to cool down and walk along the border path. The guide now and again would point to the right of the path and say “India” and point to the left and say “Nepal”.\nAn hour or so in we stopped for chai. A common occurrence during the whole trek that came to be expected and we were disappointed when we didn’t get our frequent hit of sugary milky tea. (Both Matt \u0026amp; I cannot drink tea without sugar now. I used to detest it and spent years convincing my dad to give it up. I feel such a hypocrite.)\n[ By the way Matt has now finished shaving his beard off and is scaring me with his young man looks ! ]\nStopped again for lunch of Wai Wai (chow mein noodle soup) and chai at Megma plus a quick squizz around the monastery which had 108 books bound between wooden planks and material, 108 small golden buddhas and 108 ornaments in the shape of different Hindu gods. No idea why I’m afraid. Must look it up someday.\nThe Hindu gods didn’t smile on us from then on as the heavens opened and it poured down between there and Tumling. We encased ourselves in waterproof jackets, gators and ponchos and plodded on through many streams pretending to be roads. Arrived at Tumling (across the Nepal border) and were shepherded into a cosy room with a other walkers huddle around an open fire. We took off our wet gear and was just about to settled in when our guide gestured we had to move on as the nice greedy lodge owner had already given our rooms to someone else. Back on went the rainmac, the poncho, the gators and out into the rain. 2km more to go he said.\nTrundling on 2km came and went as the lodges were again full. Just 2km further. The sun was setting now so there we were the guide, followed by Felix, followed by Arancha, followed by Matt \u0026amp; I about half a km behind heading for our last chance of a bed before darkness hit.\nWe made it to the next village where finally there was space and were led upstairs to an attic room for the 4 of us to share. Interesting but fine. It had blankets, electricity and was dry. Soup was delivered to our room and we thought that was it. Then we were invited across the street to someone else’s house for dinner of dahl, chapati, potatoes and enough rice to feed the five thousand.\nGuide said brekkie at 8am so we all agreed on a 7:30 alarm and nodded off at what must have been as late as 8.30pm.\nDay 2 – 7am the guide is knocking on the door. He wanted to show us the view – you could see a glimpse of Mt Everest and Makalu from the edge of the village. Amazing. Also got to see some chicks and baby goats too. Soooo cute! Looking around in daylight made us realise how remote a place it was and it’s unbelievable that people live in these places so far from towns. Jeeps can get up there but it must take them hours as the roads are barely passable.\nAfter more food at the neighbours for brekkie, we headed off towards Kali Pokri (3100m). It didn’t take long for the rains to come in but luckily we stopped for chai twice on the way. And arrived at 1:30pm in torrential rain.\nAgain we settled in at the first lodging our guide took us too. But then he changed his mind and we waterproofed up again and moved further down the village. This time we had our own rooms. The communal area was basically the family’s front room where cross-eyed grandad was feeding baby and we sat on plastic chairs (they love plastic garden chairs here) huddled around a makeshift fire from a spare wheel and charcoal burning in the middle of the wooden hut.\nAs the rain persisted we stayed in that same 6ft square space for 6hours, only moving from fire to table to eat lunch \u0026amp; dinner and then back again. Played batteships with A \u0026amp; F to pass the time. Tried the local/homemade brew called Tsomba (i think) which consisted of fermented millet served in a vessel that looked like a small barrel which you topped up with hot water for as long as you wanted to drink the stuff through the wooden straws. It tasted similar to liqueur or mulled wine. Very warming. Grandad seemed to really enjoy his. No wonder he was cross-eyed.\n Day 3 – up earlier hoping to miss the rain but it was relentless and we ventured out all suited up again (after good brekkie of thick pancakes and hot banana). Luckily it didn’t rain too much although it stayed misty and the colder air was good to move up the steepest part to Sandakphu. No chai stop this time as Felix wasn’t feeling well and we all decided it was better to just get there as quickly as possible. Unbelievably we were at our final highest destination by 10:30am. We were worried it meant another day of sitting around trying to pass the time as the weather was still poor. Luckily the weather cleared up mid afternoon and we ventured out to explore. Can’t say there was loads to see apart from clouds and a few hills but it was nice to wander around and get some fresh air with the sun shining.\nSat on a huge rock we watched the sun set over the hills as a group of Indian guys sat on a higher rock took our photo then started singing “One Love” by Blue completely out of tune. In the distance Snoop Dogg came blasting across the airways from a nearby lodge.\nThe temperature dropped and it was blooming freezing that night as we huddled together in a single bed in our “ensuite” room (see photo).\nDay 5 – guide had said we should be up at 5:30 to see sunrise. He had a good feeling. 5:05 there’s a knock at the door. “Come come” he says. We get up as quickly as possible. 5:15 rat-a-tat-tat. He’s waiting for us so after applying 3 pairs of socks, 2 pairs of trousers, 2 tops, 2 jumpers, a hat and grabbing a blanket we head out to the view point. And what a view. The sun is rising in the east as the moon sets in the west. The mountains are clear of clouds and as the sky brightens the colours illuminating Khangchendzonga are beautiful. In the distance the air clears more and we can see the Nepalese mountain ranges of The Three Sisters and Everest and Makalu. Wow. It just made all the effort through the pouring rain worth it. We were so so lucky. The day before visibility had been practically zero. Today it was perfect conditions. Like being on top of the world.\nThis one’s Mt Everest:\nUnbelievably just as we left Sandakphu to make our descent around 8am the clouds also descended and covered the mountains rapidly. It was as though they’d never been there.\nWe were headed for Rimbik at 2100m and 20km away so it was walking solidly downhill. As we moved away from the Nepalese border and downwards the landscape changed frequently. Wooded areas almost Forest of Dean like and then dense bamboo bushes 10 feet tall each side (we kept out eyes peeled for red panda but none in sight) back to huge trees and jungle-like palms with rivers, rapids and waterfalls. Then openness across a huge valley with remains of a forest fire from ‘88 and further down to agricultural land.\nFirst chai of the day was had at Gurdum (2300m), 3hours after we left Sandakphu so we were gasping. Gurdum was so pretty. Just a few houses on the side of a hill painted blue and green. With fuchsias and chrysanthemums and countless other flowers \u0026amp; herbs growing in pots lined up alongside the buildings. It was kind of like Calamity Jane’s house after “a woman’s touch”.\nLunch was at Goparma Lodge in Shrikhola (1900m) and we got to choose what we wanted to eat! No rice for us :) The lodge was on the riverside so Matt was off jumping onto rocks to capture the perfect pic of blurred water.\nWe left Shrikola across a dubious bridge and sadly passed a sick horse at the side of the track. It was awful to see it lying there struggling to get up. We have seen too many animals that have died or are about to. I guess if people can’t afford to buy themselves medicine they can’t do it for their animals. This idyllic place was also marred by the rubbish we saw at the side of the river. It seems all waste ends up in the water here. Such a shame.\nThe rest of the route to Rimbik was on more of a road which wound around the hills where we passed donkeys and horses carrying goods and saw many houses built of stilts. An old woman was sat on a pile of granite stones breaking more rocks and further along men were laying new tarmac using what looked like the same kind of rocks – a lot of hard manual labour.\n Reaching the lodge at Rimbik just after 4pm was a relief after a full day’s walking downhill in good weather and only one chai since breakfast. We were getting withdrawal symptoms. The lodge had a view of Sikkim to the north-east and Darjeeling to the south-east and a shower with hot water. Lush.\nThe only downside this time were the paper-thin walls between us and the pissed honeymoon couple in the room next door. Indians aren’t known for being quiet and there were far too many noises coming from their room than we would have liked to hear. Especially when the guy ended up being very ill from drinking too much. Ugh!\nDay 5 – We were planning on a lie-in as the jeep wasn’t coming til 8:30 but the beautiful sunrise together with our mousey neighbours leaving at 6am we were up and having brekkie by 7:30am. A first for us. Halfway through our toast at 7:50 the guide comes into the cafe and says the jeep is here we have to leave! Why change the habit of a lifetime?\n4 hours later and we’re back in Darjeeling. As I get out the car I realise I can hardly walk. My quads are seized up and I’m walking around like John Wayne again. Matt isn’t much better. Seems we’ve both turned into old people after 6 weeks of no exercise. Good job we did the beginner’s trek.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/11/15/days-37-to-41-wednesday-20th-to-sunday-24th-october-singalila-ridge-trek/","summary":"I thought I would try and update the blog as haven’t written for over a week.

The views at sunrise across the Himalaya mountain range spectacular, breathtaking.","title":"Days 37 to 41 – Wednesday 20th to Sunday 24th October (Singalila Ridge Trek)"},{"content":"The sun came out today. Hooray! At 3pm after umming and ahhing and umming some more in our worse than normal indecisive manner, we finally made a decision to go on the trek. At 3.05 as we left the hotel, it started raining. Half hour more of deliberating and we thought sod it lets go. Even if it’s raining its what we have wanted to do the whole time we’ve been in Darjeeling (apart from the toy train of course).\nWe popped to Footy Cafe to see if we could find the French couple who had planned to go at the same time as us. Instead we found John and Mel, the Frampton Cotterell couple, who had just got back from a 5-day trek. They were shattered and it had rained a lot but they said it was worth it. So it made us feel better about the decision.\nOn the way to confirm with Somewhere over the Rainbow treks that it was still OK to go at such short notice we spotted the French couple Nicholas and Noeline in another cafe. They had decided to wait a few more days as they have more time than us. Then in Chowrasta (the main square) we bumped into the New Zealand couple whom we’d met in Delhi half-checking in then checking out of Smyle Inn (its a small world here) who hadn’t tried Cake Lady brownies yet but who had heard of her because she’s a fellow New Zealander. So we managed to find out her name after all – its Helen (good name :) )!\nSpent the rest of the afternoon looking for hiking boots but although things are cheaper here (North Face boots are about £30-£40) we couldn’t justify buying some for the sake of one trek. So decided to hire some instead. The guy at the Trekking Shop directed us to Trek Mate to hire some. They’re a little manky but they’ll do for 40p per day. We then popped back to the Trekking Shop and found some gators (yep very stylish). He spotted our hired boots and noticed my lace was falling apart so instead of trying to flog me some of his he went off and came back with a lighted candle and proceeded to burn the ends of the lace and fixed them. What a sweetie. Darjeeling is really nothing like India!\nSo 7am tomorrow we’ll be off up a mountain or two. We’re currently at 2134 metres. The highest we will climb is approx 3600 metres. Wish us luck.\nBack Sunday……\n  ps food update – ate lots of lush street food today, it’s so much better than the cafes and restaurants here – eggs rolls again, veg chowmein and samosas. Yum.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/10/19/day-36-tuesday-19th-october-darjeeling/","summary":"The sun came out today. Hooray!

October and November’s clear skies and warm temperatures make it an ideal time to trek…” says the Lonely Planet.\nWe wouldn’t know. For the past few days we have wanted to go on the Singalila trek where you can walk to a height of 3600m at Sandakphu and see the top of Everest clearly but the weather is beating us. The rain has followed us from the UK and it won’t go away!\nWe arrived in Darjeeling last Monday. After a long, overnight train journey from Varanasi to New Jalpaiguri we jumped in the back of a jeep (no seatbelts) with 7 other passengers and our backpacks secured to the roof and 3hrs, 2200m, a stop at a hillside cafe to pour water on the steaming engine and some very bumpy roads we reached Darjeeling train station. Just in time to catch the steam engine rolling out down the hill.\nThe views were spectacular. The rolling mountains and colourful hillside buildings were breathtaking. This place is unlike any other in India (that we have seen so far). Relaxing, chilled, no hassle, no touts. LessFewer people, friendlier, more varied people who look indian, nepalese and tibetan.\nWe made our way up the steep winding road to what feels like the top of Darjeeling and found our Hotel Tranquility, run by a lovely guy who put us at ease immediately. We stayed in one of the back rooms the first night as it was the only one available but he told us he’d move us as soon as a better room became available. Sure enough the next day our bags were moved to a room with a view. And what a view. It’s like being on top of the world!\nTuesday to Thursday we felt we needed to acclimatise. Going from 119m to 2134m in one go was more of shock to the system than we’d anticipated. We suffered in both similar and different ways. Our sinuses were blocked and we kept sneezing. I felt dizzy and sick and Matt has had a crappy cough since we arrived which is only just getting better.\nAfter a few days we started looking into doing a trek. We had thought about going up to Sikkim but then decided to try the Singalila trek first to see how we got on. The only problem was the weather took a turn for the worst on Thursday so we thought we’d leave it until after the we weekend when the forecast looked to be improving.\nHaha. Yesterday you could hardly see anything outside of the window the clouds were so thick. Today it was brighter so we popped to the zoo around lunchtime. 90mins later it was belting it down and the rainclouds quickly descended around us until the air was a heavy dew. We had our raincoats so we trundled around the zoo looking at soggy red pandas and dripping wet himalayan wolves. It was a lovely zoo though. Most of the enclosures were a good size for the animals they housed and they were very similar to their natural habitat with lots of trees, plants and rocks. Nothing like the concrete enclosures in many British Zoos. The Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park has a number of breeding programs to help endangered species such as the Snow Leopard, the Red Panda, Tibetan Wolf and the Himalayan Newt (these guys could swim fast!).\nThe Himalayan Mountaineering Institute (HMI) was also inside the grounds and told the stories of the attempts to climb Everest up to the first successful one in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hilary and local man Tenzing Norgay who barely gets a mention anywhere else. It was amazing the amount of equipment those guys had to take with them. We thought it was a shame that the flag they’d left there was now in that museum!\nOne thing we have learned in India, especially in Darjeeling, is that it takes FOREVER to make a cup of chai. Today in the HMI “restaurant” was a record 45 mins. Ridiculous. We’d thought we just pop in for a quick drink whilst it was tipping it down. In Britain, when you order food and drink, the drink usually comes first. Not here. You’re usually halfway through your meal before your cuppa materialises!\nAnother thing we’ve discovered in Darjeeling is fab street-food. The delicious freshly steamed vegetable momos, the deep-fried pastry filled with beans and onion that looks like a flat pasty covered in chilly sauce and scrumptious egg rolls complete with chopped carrot and cucumber, tomato sauce and of course the obligatory chilly sauce. Delicious!\nWe have also discovered Cake Lady! She makes the best chocolate brownies ever. We met her by accident in Hot Pizza Place as she brought along her 30th cake delivery of the day. A traveller (from Oz we think) she is probably younger than us and came to Darjeeling a couple of years ago. Travelled on around India but loved this place so much she came back and 18 months later is still here. Her cake business came from the idea that there are hardly any decent cakes in Darjeeling. We have to almost agree with her. The large chocolate topped doughnuts available in lots of street stalls are pretty tasty. But Cake Lady cakes and biscuits have an edge. Her business plan seems to be to make the cakes to order and sell them out of restaurants and cafes all over Darjeeling. Genius. We must find out her name if we can before we leave.\nHave you noticed we’re eating a lot of cake here? We will be appearing fatter in our photos very soon I promise.\nApart from eating lots of cake and eating lots of other things we haven’t done a great deal else in Darjeeling. Our one other touristy day other than the zoo today was what we came here for. The toy train. We took the “joyride” 2hr 30min round trip from Darjeeling to Ghoom and back in 1st class where the seat backs switched direction depending on which way the train was facing. The train chugged it’s way up the toy track and stopped halfway to take on more water. With the windows open for lots of photographic moments, we often got covered in water and soot. Yes it was very sad. We felt like an old couple taking a steam engine for fun but it was fun and if it’s good enough for Michael Palin it’s good enough for us! :)\nThe photos paint a better picture:\nSo in 7 days in Darjeeling we have been on a train and to the zoo and that’s about it. It’s amazing how much time goes by doing nothing at all. I am feeling pretty guilty that we’re not doing something more constructive. But its difficult when most things here are reliant on the weather being good. We really didn’t appreciate the view of Khangchendzonga (8598m – 3rd highest in Himalaya) on our first day in Darjeeling. Since then we haven’t had a glimpse. Fingers-crossed the sun comes out soon otherwise we’ll start looking like enormous American tourists with our bellies full of Cake Lady goodies.\nMore photos of darjeeling to come later…\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/10/19/days-29-35-tuesday-12th-to-monday-18th-october-darjeeling/","summary":"“A number of rewarding and picturesque treks are accessible from Darjeeling.

The people were rude, and the city was filthy.\nI’m over that initial culture-shock now (realising it was basically just Delhi) and am now really enjoying India. It’s a mad place, there’s no escaping that, but we’ve met some lovely people and already experienced a lifetime worth of bizarre events.\nWhen you walk down a street (intermittent sewage cover) in India you soon get used to every shopkeeper saying “Hello”, “Namaste”, “Where are you from?” (they all think I’m French for some reason), “Come in, it’s free to look” etc. Earlier a chap said to Karen: “Come in, I have beautiful clothes for your pretty face”. I pointed to my chest, smiled and joked: “For me? Oh thanks…” but he quickly, and seriously corrected me: “No, not you, I meant her”. Pfft.\nWe watched James Bond (Octopussy) in Udaipur. Every other cafe/restaurant there shows it daily because most of it was filmed there. A cheesy touristy thing to do but we enjoyed it :)\nWe also stayed up with some of the boys that work in our hotel there and drank Chai tea. Their English was a bit patchy and when combined with our sloppy accents we basically had two different conversations. Whenever we asked them a question they either pointed to the tea and explained that in India they call it “Chai” or gave me a lesson on how to light an incense stick with a match.\nWhen we went back to Delhi to watch the commonwealth games we got stopped by a mini TV crew that interviewed us for our thoughts on the organisation of the event. Not sure if it got aired since I basically said that it was a shame they left everything so late. It could have been so much more successful. I’m not saying we didn’t enjoy it, it was great, it just could have been so much better.\nIn Darjeeling now which is very chilled, nothing like the India we’ve seen so far.

More tuk-tuk touts than you can shake a stick at but a very spiritual and dream-like place.\nPaul van der Werf from the train joined us and we made our way to Chaitanya Guest House in Assi Ghat which is the most southerly ghat in Varanasi and was very pleasant. There wasn’t the same amount of hustle and bustle here as in the old city which Varanasi is famous for.\nChaitanya Guest House was run by a friendly quiet man who we hardly saw. The room was very pretty with 3 stained glass windows and a view of the Ganges. Every morning we were woken by the sun streaming through the window arches and the sound of the pipe seller walking up and down the path playing his tunes with at least 50 pipes splayed on his shoulder.\nAt dusk the three of us hired a rowing boat with 3 men aboard to take us up the Ganges to see the sights. There was some discussion around the price as the river was high they wanted 1000 rupees. We didn’t really understand why the height of the river made any difference to the cost and so after some bartering and to-ing and fro-ing they agreed on 400 rupees.\nSunny, the youngest (maybe 18 or 19) rowed us most of the way there passing all of the other ghats which were a mixture of old and new, some amazing and some ugly concrete structures. Babu, the second oldest, gave us some info on Varanasi and the oldest guy steered the boat with a third oar. After about half an hour we reached the burning ghat “Manikarnika Ghat” where they carry out cremations 24/7. Paul went ashore to see the cremations up close but us two stayed on the boat. I think Matt would have liked to have gone but stayed with me. Whilst Paul was gone Babu asked me how old I was. When I said 32 he was shocked. He said he thought I was older! Not because of my face, he said I had a young face but my hair was old. Ah the grey again. It’s getting really bad. In India they don’t normally go grey until 50 or 60 so he was surprised at my age. Really need to get some hair dye :)\nNot detracting too much from the burning ghat by discussing hair colour, the fact Babu doesn’t have a doctor because he keeps his health by drinking from and bathing in the Ganges (which in places is septic) and then showing me his “bhang” wrapped in a leaf which you can chew with sugar, the atmosphere here was ghostly and I felt like I shouldn’t be there. There were fires lit on the bank of the ghat and a number of boats with tourists gathered around. Paul said he’d seen some of the bodies being laid on the fires but it didn’t seem like it was real because they were wrapped up. Still it seemed liked we shouldn’t have been there at all. Apparently certain bodies aren’t burned but thrown wrapped into the Ganges. These include pregnant women and babies. I was sure I saw someone throw a small bundle into the river whilst we were waiting for Paul. That spooked me and I kept looking for bundles all the way back. At one point we all spotted a large form floating in the river and was relieved (although still something I’d not want to see again) to realise it was a dead cow.\nWe next stopped at the main ghat Dasaswamedh Ghat where the daily ritual “ganga aarti” was being performed. Guys dreessed in bright orange and gold were either clinking symbols or moving various flame filled items around their heads whilst another guy struck a gong over and over. Our boat pulled up behind a larger flat-roofed vessel and we were able to climb up onto the roof to get a better look. Whilst the older guy bailed out some of the water from our boat.\nAgain it was dream-like. I can’t describe exactly what it felt like to be there. But it was fascinating to watch and realise that they do this every day for an hour and it is a normal part of life here. In the UK if anyone did the same they’d be laughed at.\nIt was pretty dark when we left the ritual and both Sunny and Babu had to row as the current was so strong going back down the river. It took an hour to get back to Assi Ghat and at points we were rowed to the edge of a ghat and pushed by guys on the bank to get us around the strong current. We felt helpless watching the two guys struggle with the boat. Now we understood why they wanted more money. We felt we should give them more than we agreed.\nBefore setting off we had bought lotus flowers from a small girl who had persisted with me for 10mins whilst we negotiated prices. They are small bowls made of pressed dried leaves with flower petals and a candle. Good for the karma. So we lit these on the way back and watched them float for a couple of seconds before being taken into the Ganges by the current.\nHonestly that experience just feels like a dream now. It was very unreal and we can’t quite believe it happened. That we were sat on a rowing boat in the dark on the Ganges watching cremations and Hindu rituals.\n Reality hit when we tried to go out to eat. Being in Assi Ghat meant that there was not a large choice of restaurants nearby. So we decided to head for the Shanti Guest House rooftop restaurant near the burning ghat. It took us 20 mins to get a tuk-tuk (how come there’s always thousands when you don’t want one and none when you do?!) and then we had a 15min walk down the windiest streets I’ve seen to find this place in the back and beyond. On the way out when we asked directions to the main road, rather than trying to explain the guy walked us there as it was such a maze. Though the alleyways were narrow they were filled with men marching towards the burning ghat, carrying a stretcher with a wrapped up body. Another heading for cremation and eternal life in the Ganges.\n Paul left for Kathmandu on Sunday and we being our usually lazy selves didn’t venture that far. Found the best pizza place so far though right next to Assi Ghat so we watched the smaller ganga aarti ceremony there whilst eating spinach pizza and apple pie and ice-cream. We did think about going to the fort but it was so hot in Varanasi you couldn’t stay in the heat very long.\nAs Monday was checking out day and we were leaving Varanasi we settled down at Open Hand Cafe for 6 hours. Yes six. It was a really inspiring little place. Both a cafe and craft shop inter-mingled you sat drinking coffee amongst scarves, handbags, artwork and furnishings. Everything was of a high quality and had been hand-made by physically challenged women and it was all fixed price so no bartering needed. A fairtrade cafe come gift shop with a chilled out atmosphere, good food, good music – just the kind of place I could see myself running :)\n After sitting on our backsides all day we headed to Mughal Sarai train station 20km away. Half the road there was missing as usual so it was an obstacle course but then we somehow managed to join a huge highway. There we were in this little tuk-tuk speeding past trucks beeping his horn as we went as though that would have made much difference to those monsters! I think we hit 35mph. The fastest we’ve been in a tuk-tuk. Matt had made a deal with the driver – we had to be there by 6pm or we wouldn’t pay. 5.55 we arrived so we paid the man.\nOur train was delayed by almost 2 hours in the end and when we found our seats everyone was ready for bed, as were the guys who had our seats. They moved out of the way but refused to leave the carriage and were adamant they were sleeping on the floor. They had been on the “waitlist” which means you buy a ticket with the potential that a seat may come free if someone else cancelled. Normally you don’t board the train if your name isn’t on the list at the station but these guys did. Matt politely asked them to move but it must be normal for people to board without a valid ticket and sleep wherever they fancy because we gave in in the end and I think at least one of them slept in between the two lower bunks!\nWe also met another English couple today in our train compartment who happened to be from Thornbury and Frampton Cotterell. Small world.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/10/14/days-26-28-saturday-9th-to-monday-11th-october-varanasi/","summary":"Varanasi has been our most surreal experience yet in India.

We bumped into two girls Abby and Beth (speech therapists from London) who were also off to see the athletics later. Coincidentally (i’m going to say that alot in these blogs) they were in the same block as us. So we travelled together to the stadium and watched the 100m mens and women’s finals.\nThe women’s was controversial because there was almost a false start because of the noise the crowd were making. An indian shotputter was taking his turn just when the women were getting ready on their blocks. And when an indian athlete did anything the crowds went mental. There was no co-ordination between the field events and track events so this scenario happened quite a few times.\nThen there really was a false start. And the rule is now if you false start you don’t get another chance. You’re disqualified immediately. The screen looked like the Aussie girl and our girl Laura Turner. But only Laura was identified and she strongly disagreed so ran it anyway. She unfortunately came last then although she should have won it. Instead the Aussie girl won it. And our other English girl Endecott came 4th. Turns out now the Aussie did false start so has been disqualified which moves Endecott to 3rd. But Matt read yesterday that the Nigerian who moved up to gold has failed a drug test so our girl may get a silver in the end!\nWe also watched the decathlon guys doing the high jump which was pretty cool. The welsh guy got everyone clapping for him and the english guy ended up jumping the highest which was cool.\nWe left earlier than yesterday so we had a good chance of getting back in time to eat at Sam’s cafe. So we headed there for more pizza with Abby and Beth.

Yes it will be ready later. Come back at noon. Ok so merrily we go off to get brekkie @ Sam’s Cafe. I won’t even go into that…\nBack at 12 and the guy is oh i’m sorry we still have no room. do you mind staying at the other hotel another night? Um yes we do bloody mind mate. He starts throwing free cartons of juice at us to placate us. And you should have come for free breakfast he said. Sod the bloody breakfast where is our room? So off in a huff we go to HUI and cunningly ask the guy how much our room is. He struggles to say immediately but blurts our 450 rupees. Why that little *\u0026amp;%*!! was charging us 690 per night. What a scammer. So with some confrontation from the Smyle Inn and protests of well you get free internet and breakfast blah blah blah, we officially moved ourselves from Smyle Inn to Unique International and paid 450 per night direct rather than via a middleman.\nAnyway enough about hotels and all that boring stuff. We came back to Delhi for a reason – the Commonwealth Games (CWG)!\nWell what can we say. The metro was good. Got there fine. 4.15 and the games were due to start at 5.30 so plenty of time to find a seat. Went through the main gate easy. Got to security no problem except for Matt had a 5 rupee coin in his pocket. No coins allowed. They’re a hazard. Need to throw it away. Where’s the charity box matt asks. No charity box, need to bin. Matt doesn’t want to leave his camera as it’s already gone through the scanners and he hasn’t but he has to go back to the bin. Dilemma. So he throws the coin at the bin and bingo scores! Matt’s highlight of the trip so far ;)\nWe find our block A29 and it’s empty. Not a soul. So we head to get some food. There is one food place for the whole of A block. It is a room with 2 tables. Behind one table is one guy taking orders and money. This guy then shouts the order across to the 3 guys stood behind the second table and between them they get the bottle out of the fridge and/or the pre-wrapped food off the shelf.\nNot surprisingly this system isn’t working too well and the queue although not that long at this point is taking a while. We finally get to the front and order our food. Sorry no food. Come back in 15-20 mins. Great all that for a bottle of coke.\nSo off back to A29 with our coke. Sorry sir you can’t take food and drink to your seats. You have to stay here. So we loiter at the top of the block with our coke. 20mins later off we trot back to the food place. This time there are 20 people in front of us. The queue is snaking around the room. The same system is in place. It’s a joke. It takes us 25mins to get 2 veggie burgers (we wanted wraps – there were none only veggie burgers) and a water. By that time the games are just about to start. But we have to eat at the top of the block. Lucky there were only about 10 people in total in A29 so we could still sit anywhere.\nHalf the stadium is empty. It’s bizarre. We are sat on the opposite side to the 100m track so can hardly see anything going on on that side. Plus all the blocks on the other side are practically empty too. Very very bizarre.\nWe also stayed til the bitter end to see the medal ceremonies and we were literally the last people to leave!\nI won’t even go into the palava it took to get back with the metro where 100 times the number of people that could fit pushed their way onto a train without letting anyone off.

We’d booked far enough in advance to get the side upper and side lower beds in a 3AC carriage which meant we could sit opposite each other and go to bed whenever we wanted without worrying about anyone else.\nIt was an 18 hr journey but didn’t feel like it as from 21.30 til 7.30 we were pretty much sleeping. The evening was occupied with reading and interruptions of “chai, chai chai”, “coffee, nescafe, coffee” etc. And we were even served an evening meal. It was kind of like airplane food. A thali consisting of different runny concoctions, raita and chapati served in separate cartons in a cardboard box. It was tasty enough for 45 rupees.\nThe only downside of the sleeper is sharing the carriage with 62 other people and the chances of there being an extremely good snorer amongst that number of people is pretty high. The chances of them being in the bed next to us not so high but there he was somehow sleeping through his 140dB of snorting which the earplugs struggled to muffle. But despite that with the gentle rocking of the train running at 10mph we were lulled into some kind of sleep like babies in a cot.\nUnfortunately reality hit when we arrived at New Delhi train station. Oops sorry Old Delhi train station. Bloomin typical. We’d booked accommodation specifically near New Delhi train station and ended up somewhere else! So it meant fighting tooth and nail to get a fair price for a tuk-tuk to Paharganj where our hotel was. It took “discussions” with about 10 tuk-tuk drivers who ranged from 150 rupees down to 100 and we knew darn well it wouldn’t cost that much. But because of the CWG they’d craftily inflated their prices. Eventually someone gave in and took us on the meter which turned out to be 70 ruppes (although that was still a bit of a con cos the meter said 35. something to do with 2 people or number of kilometres or something. I couldn’t be arsed to argue with the man. It was hot by then and we needed a shower. Also a poor homeless kid was grabbing my arm. And although I wanted to get away from him as soon as possible I felt bad for not helping him. He looked completely zonked out and had some hair missing with a huge scar on his head. It’s terrible the amount of begging children you see here. I don’t know what to do to help.\nThis area of Delhi is called Pahar Ganj and is the budget accommodation area. It was cordoned off with security at either end so was relatively pedestrianised which was nice. We passed many tourists \u0026amp; travellers along the road which was complete contrast to the last area we stayed in. Lots of cafes and shops and touts.\nFound Smyle Inn down at winding sidestreet of Pahar Ganj (which reminded us of the old underground streets of Edinburgh) and they’d managed to somehow overbook themsleves. Even though we’d again booked in advance knowing it would be busy due to the CWG. The guy was full of apologies and sent us to the hotel next door. His friend’s place. Good place yes. Only one night yes. Ok we agreed we understand. So he ployed us with free water and loo roll and off we went to Hotel Unique International (HUI) next door. Hmmm unique it certainly was. No windows and an A/C shaft going up the middle of the building which wasn’t sealed in so we could hear everything in all rooms. Who was chatting, who was showering, that the reception guys were watching Who wants to be a millionaire (a favourite all over India we’ve found) plus the birds nesting in the rooftop. There was also a distinct odour de urine so we quickly bought some incense sticks.\nWe thought 1 night will be fine. We’ll move tomorrow.\nPahar Ganj, Delhi\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/10/13/day-22-tuesday-5th-october-delhi-cwg/","summary":"Our first experience of a sleeper train was pretty good.

Time is flying by very fast.\nMatt had a couple of days rest plus bought a course of antibiotics from the medical stall in the square for a quid and was ready to do the camel trek. We opted for a 1.5 day trek as we needed to get back by Monday afternoon for our trip to Delhi.\n7.30am we were taken by open jeep (very cool vehicle – we all want one!) to a random place at the roadside about 30mins drive away where our camels and guides were waiting for us. We were legged-up straight onto the camels padded backs (dromedary rather bactrian). No instruction booklet provided. Just “lean back” as the camel gets up and down.\nImmediately it felt easy to be sat atop these intriguing animals plodding through the barren land of routh dry soil and patches of grass and shrubs. I say barren – there were a few roads and electricity pylons plus wind turbines in the distance but it didn’t spoil it. We also passed nomadic people now and again living in a mud hut at the side of their crops.\nMatt \u0026amp; Camel\nMy camel, Johnny Walker, was tied to the lead camel, Michael Jackson, so was pretty obedient and we seemed to be ahead of the pack for most of the trek. Matt on the other hand was given free “rein” and his camel (coincidentally also called Johnny – perhaps a family name?) would wander off on its own accord whenever it felt like it.\nMichael seemed to be suffering from a severe bout of IBS so Johhny Walker’s nose (and my own) was filled with loud trumpets of hot air and suspicious aromas for 80% of the trip.\nCamel!\nAfter 3 hours and seeing a couple of gazelles and an eagle we stopped under a large tree to rest in the shade. It was a challenge getting off. Straddling a camel isn’t the most natural sitting position for any person so it can kind of rub a bit after a while.\nThe camels were unloaded of their saddles and blankets and ropes were tied around their front two legs so they hopped skipped and jumped off to chommp on some grass whilst we lazed around and drank masala chai and ate cabbage curry and chapati.\nThere were 5 of us on the trek. Nathalie from Holland and Elizabeth and Tom from London. Last September the latter two had left their jobs in PR and investment banking to take a world trip and India was their last country before heading home in December. It was great to meet another couple who were at the end of the adventure we are just beginning. They said it had been the best thing they had ever done and they were envious that we were at the start. They also said that India was the hardest country they’d travelled around so it would get easier from here. That was music to Matt’s ears! As although India is an interesting and diverse country it is so crazy and disorganised and hectic and exhausting. Tom and Elizabeth aren’t the only travellers to have said that to us either.\n14:30 back on the camels for 3 more hours. Must say we did stop a couple of times in the morning and afternoon at ponds for the camels to have a drink. At one pool of water as we were leaving, some farmers were herding what must have been at least 100 cows towards the water’s edge.\nIt got much much hotter that afternoon and the fun idea of trekking on a camel was wearing thin as we grew sweatier and sweatier and our backsides ached more and more. At last at 5.30 we reached the Sam sand dunes where we were met by some poor bloke who’d walked from the nearest village to meet us with a huge sack of cold sodas and beers on his back. We were very grateful!\nWe sat on the hot sand and guzzled our Thumbs Up (a sweeter sicklier version of Coca Cola – Matt says he can’t tell the difference with normal coca cola though but no suprise there with his tastebuds). Surrounded by small holes in the sand we only had to wonder for 5 mins what had made them as the dung beetles starting emerging. I didn’t realise they could fly.\nWe watched the sun set over the dunes as the guides cooked us more food and masala chai and once we’d eaten and because it was now dark it was time for bed. At 19:30.\nWe laid our on duvets on the sand dunes looking up at the stars. I have never seen so many in my life. We could even clearly see the milky way. It was an humbling experience.\nAnd even though we were out in the open with creepy crawlies around we weren’t bothered by them because we were in their environment. Not in some unclean hotel room. And we had a pretty good night’s sleep as the air was fresh and it even got a bit nippy – a refreshing change from the stifling heat in Jaisalmer.\nSunrise on the dunes\nThe next morning the sun rise was as spectacular as the sun set. The sillohuettes of the camels stood on the dunes with the early red sun behind them was beautiful.\nBreakfast consisted of toast and jam and boiled eggs. We all politely ate an egg in true English style. Even though we knew there was a high risk of food-poisoning as the eggs had been tied to the back of Johnny Walker for the entire trip and our bottled water had heated during the day from ice-cold to luke-warm tea temperature so those eggs must have been half-boiled in the sun!\nNo-one wanted to get back on the camels though as we were still walking like John Wayne but we had to head off at 7.30am to stay as cool as possible for as long as possible. So Matt started experimenting with sitting positions and found facing backwards was an interesting alternative. Sideways seemed to be the winner though. I tried a number of times to maneouvre but it is bloody difficult to swing your leg over the front of a camel whilst its plodding up and down. (should have seen some of the non-photographs i took whilst sat on it). And the longer you’re sat in one position the heavier your legs become and the sorer your ass. Eventually I made myself swing sideways. Just out of sheer agony as i couldn’t stand it any more. And it was sooo much comfier. Typically we arrived back at the jeep half an hour later :)\nThe camel trek was amazing. The best bit was sleeping under the stars. If we could have done that for a couple more nights without having to trek anywhere we would have all jumped at it.\nThe sad thing was on the morning trek back to the jeep we saw a dead camel which must have collapsed on another trek. It was being eaten by crows. And it made me wonder how well the camels are actually looked after. A lot of animals here seem to be left and forgotten about once they get sick. But i don’t think that many people can afford medical treatment for themsleves let alone their animals. I was reading recently that 26% of indians can’t pay for treatment. There is no welfare support or nhs in this country.\nWe asked the guides how much a camel is to buy. 25-30k rupees. That’s about £500. To us that seems like nothing. To them it’s too much. They don’t own the camels. They can’t afford to. They get a monthly wage of 1500 ruppes – about £20. And that’s not a bad wage as some people in India get as little as 1 rupee a day. It’s screwed up completely.\nJohnny Walker \u0026amp; Friends\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/10/13/days-20-21-sunday-3rd-monday-4th-october-jaisalmer-camel-trek/","summary":"I am writing this in retrospect and cannot believe it’s over a week since we did the camel trek.

We left Mt Abu at 8am. 14 bloody hours it took to get here!\nThe Lonely Planet says there is a direct bus from Mt Abu to Jaisalmer which takes 11 hours. There isn’t.\nThe Lonely Planet says there are A/C buses available. There aren’t.\nWe sat on a hot sweaty bus for 7hrs to Jodphur. Bumping up and down and all over the place. Stopping for any person who decided they wanted to get on or off.\nWe had one “loo”stop. I say “loo” in the looses of terms. I almost gagged it was so disgusting. That was when I almost lost it and got a bit emotional. I ended up going back to it because it was the only option available to find another lady just doing her business in the middle of the block and gesturing to me to do the same. I have used some grotty loos in my time but that one takes the biscuit!\nOn arriving in Jodphur we were bombarded with more taxi drivers and I almost lost it again. I just wanted my personal space and some peace and quiet. Things that seem rare over here which is why the trek up the Araveli (*need to check this name out) mountains was a lifesaver and a definite highlight.\nWe made our way to the train station where the LP said there were travel places to try and book our next bus. 3rd time lucky, the LP was right and we found the Maradev travels place. The guy was really helpful and we booked onto the 4.45 bus so had 45 mins to get some grub. Found a lovely restaurant in amongst all the crappy buildings and ordered some nice western bland food as we were going to be travelling on another bus. I ordered Aubergine \u0026amp; Vegetable au gratin. Well it was a good job I wasn’t that hungry as we worked out they may have got their “pommes” and “pomme de terres” mixed up and completely forgot the aubergine. It was basically a bowl of bechemal sauce with about 10 peas, two chunks of carrot and a sliced up apple! If we’d had more time we would have complained but we were in a rush. When leaving the guy asked why we hadn’t eaten it and I explained about the apple and it was a bit sweet but he was adamant it was aubergine. Funny tasting aubergine is all I can say. It would have made an interesting dessert!!\nOnto the next bus station and to the bus to Jaisalmer. We were told to put our backpacks in the boot of the bus. Only to then be asked for 10 rupees for a “guarantee”. Bugger off we said and Matt brought the bags back onto the bus so we could “guarantee” them ourselves.\nThat’s one thing that’s been a running theme in India. Asking for money for anything. Probably because we are blatantly tourists. We get stared at a lot. People walk by us on the bus just to have a look at us. The kids are quite sweet when they come and say hello but the adults you feel are going to try and get something out of you for nothing. That was what was so refreshing about Charles from the trek yesterday. He was so different to most of experiences.\nAnyway the rest of the bus journey was pretty uneventful. We had no curtains on the windows this time so managed to see a lot of the countryside and more towns and villages. They all look very similar. Very dusty and half-finished buildings everywhere. And lots and lots of rubbish. There were people sat on top of our bus and we could see them throwing packets over the side as the bus drove on. It’s so sad that it seems to be the norm to leave rubbish wherever you are. With the mentality I guess that someone else will clear it up. But it seems that brush and brush and brush to clear the rubbish to the edge of their village and leave it there accumulating. We see the animals foraging around in the piles of rubbish, chewing plastic bags. I really don’t know what the solution is. Where would it go? To a landfill site like in the UK? Or to another country also like in the UK?\nI know I am sounding pretty negative in this entry but I think there has to be lows as well as highs so you can appreciate the good stuff even more.\nLuckily once in Jaisalmer things are looking up. For a change we’d booked ahead so we were met at the bus station and taken straight here to Hotel Renuka. Which contrastly is lovely, clean and has friendly staff and a rooftop restaurant with great views of the main fort. Feeling much happier now. Although Matt is poorly at the moment poor thing. We hope he’s feeling better soon for an overnight camel trek.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/10/01/day-17-thursday-30th-september-mt-abu-to-jaisalmer-big-rant/","summary":"We arrived in Jaisalmer at 10pm.

Hope you have a fab day and the card arrives in one piece without Rex chewing it up! x x x\n Mt Abu is unsurprisingly at the top of a mountain and the bus driver was a normal Indian driver – overtaking on bends and liking the edge of the road rather than the safer side. But we got here in one piece to another lake side town. The environment is plusher up here than in Udaipur. Lots of greenery and palm trees.\nAfter traipsing round for half hour or so in the midday sun we settled on Lake View hotel which says it all in the name. The view is perfect – across Nakki Lake with hills either side and a palace on top. Shame about the room which seems to atrract all the bugs in town for a party at dusk but you can’t have it all.\nWe’d heard that Mt Abu town was a place for honeymooners who come from Guajarat (not the reason we came here i need to add). But it is not dissimilar to Weston-super-mare. Dodgy fast-food joints, amusement arcades, loads of mr whippy stalls (or mr “softy” as they’re called here), people selling lots of tat and numerous groups of teenagers loitering about.\nPlus cheesy pedalos as a bonus. We opted for a Shikara (no not the singer) which is kind of like a gondola where you sit back and relax on a huge padded seat whilst a guy paddles you around the lake for a very chilled out half an hour. We did it twice. The first time being the best as it was just before sunset so really cool colours \u0026amp; patterns on the lake and in the sky and our “driver” liked to sing a little too.\nAs there didn’t seem to be much happening in the town we decided on a morning trek with Charles (Mahendra Dan) from Mt Abu Treks. This was our first ever trek so we opted for the easy one to see what it was like. 7am today Charles met us at the hotel and a taxi took us up to the highest point in Rajasthan.\nFrom there he took us on a 3.5 hour wander across the Alvari* hills (none are actually called Mt Abu) with some amazing views and even made masala chai on a small fire on the rocks.\nIt was so peaceful up there. No-one but the three of us.\nWe immmediately warmed to Charles. He was an open and honest chap. Spiritual and passionate about what he does.\nWhen he found out Matt was a software expert he borrowed him for an hour to help improve his blog site and in return he took us to his home and whilst we sat on a huge rock looking out over Nakki Lake as the sun lowered he made us milk coffee and cheese toasties. Proper cheese toastie. None of the crap we had last night at Kings Food restaurant which was 2 pieces of toast and some grated cheese inbetween!\nThere’s lots more I could write about Charles but we need to write on his blog page so i’ll stick the URL here….http://www.mount-abu-treks.blogspot.com. (We’ll be updating soon – though I’m not sure we can write well enough to do it justice – it will be a definite Recommendation).\nAfter pottering around a bit more and not feeling overly hungry we ate corn on the cob from the streetstalls who shove it directly into the burning coals andthen rub it with chilli powder and lemon and serve it back in the corn skin. It was delicious. We of course had to finish off with a Mr Softy which was served in a 2 cones (yes one inside the other!!) and tasted like that fluuffy marshmallow gunk you had on toast when you were a kid. Sweet to say the least.\nAnother night of sleeping with the light on – not as many bugs as last night as Matt had an ingenious plan of blocking up the doorway with a blanket. I don’t mind little bugs but some of these things are massive beetle/grasshoppeer/jumpy/cockroach-looking things and they were not surviving in our room any longer than they had to! We probably flattened about 20 to 30 of the critters all shapes and sizes before settling down to sleep.\n_\n*need to check spelling_\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/10/01/day-16-wednesday-29th-september-mt-abu/","summary":"Firstly Happy Birthday to my dad!

We were lucky to get a personal lesson as we were the only 2 students. Normally there are between 6 and 12. Matt became a dab-hand at stirring curry paste and flipping chapati. He’s going to be doing all the cooking when we get back to England :)\nShakti is apparently a bit of a celebrity around these ere parts. He had Jamie Oliver’s assistant attend one of his classes and then buy saffron for the great chef himself.\nThere are newspaper clippings on the wall about his businesses. I loved the bit about somebody saying he was like England’s Delia Smith. So for a long time he told everyone he was Delia Smith. Until one lady pointed out that Delia is in fact a woman so he felt embaressed. Then another person said you’re like Jamie Oliver and Shakti had to check – is Jamie a he or she?\nThe cooking class only lasted 90 mins but we got a good insight into traditional indian cooking and have some lush recipes to try back home including masala chai which is delicious. We also ate everything we cooked and more so feeling extremely bleugh now – who said we would lose weight in india? i feel stuffed to the brim most days!\nWe have had our first experience of an indian laundry. our clothes have come back clean, ironed and folded and how they ever knew that they were our clothes as soon as we arrived i’ll never know. they don’t give tickets or take names or any kind of reference. it just gets bundled up into one pile when you leave it there and comes back in a neat pile the next day. miracle. 10 items cost 120 rupees (about £1.70)\nWe move on again tomorrow to Mt Abu in the west. And again it will be a shame to leave. We have met some lovely people and the place is beautiful. perhaps too many rickshaws and motorbikes running you over as they try to overtake through a 4 inch gap on a corner and bloody expensive loo paper but otherwise a magical place that i could come back to one day (especially to stay in one of the top-end hotels!)\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/09/27/day-14-27th-september-udaipur/","summary":"Yesterday went for a gorgeous romantic meal at Ambrai restaurant overlooking Lake Pichola, Lake Palace Hotel on Jagniwas Island and City Palace.

Going there every day for a couple of slices.\nAlso we moved hotel on Tuesday from skanky Hotel Sanjay to lovely clean Hotel Rising Star and they do lush banana pancakes for breakfast.\nThe first night we stayed there they had a festival in the hotel. A group of men sat cross-legged with instruments singing Hindu songs in front of a type of “altar” with the hindi god Ganesh and two photos of elderly people who we think must have died had garlands of orange flowers hung over them. They used microphones and a very loud PA system which boomed out into the streets around until 1am. That seems to be the norm here!\nIncense burned all around and we together with some other travellers plus the wives dressed in bright-coloured saris and their children sat and watched the singing.\nWe didn’t realise at the time but that was the beginning of the Ganesh Festivities and yesterday was the main procession through the streets.\nIt was crazy and so much fun. The procession came down the main narrow street. There were dancing lads with drums followed by a truck load of kids throwing flowers followed by groups of lads dancing covered in pink powder paint followed by more trucks of kids and flowers and bananas (offerings to the god Ganesh,. god of good fortune).\nAfter watching them crawling down the street for half an hour we decided to head down a side-street so we could head to the front of the procession again. But we managed to choose a street (narrower still) with more procession. Brass band after brass band. Flowers and bananas being thrown. Boys on horseback. Teenage boys spinning spears erratically and then fighting with them. I wanted to get away from these guys but they spotted Matt’s camera and all crowded round us wanting a photo. Then we had to have one with them! (That’s one thing we’ve had on a number of occassions now – indians getting their camera phones out and snapping us with their family or mates!)\nI was then dragged off by a young girl asking me to dance with her and her friends. I gave in and went with her and we ended up dancing in the middle of a brass band – it was very surreal! (Matt has embaressing photos :)\nWe almost got stampeded at one point too by a cow as it got up onto the steps we were on (who said cows can’t go up and down stairs was wrong!) and headed straight for us. We had to jump off into the procession to get out of the way. Then i could see why – it had spotted Matt’s banana on the floor which he’d been given by the kids and wolfed it down in onw gulp! Then carried on it’s merry way back down into the street.\nBlue higgledy piggledy buildings, the streets carpeted with orange and pink flowers and people in brightly coloured costumes made it feel dream-like. There’s definitely something to be said about spiritual celebrations.\nThere have bene some negatives – we were conned by a “priest” who took us down to one of the ghats and gave us flowers to throw into the water whilst chanting. Which was a good experience until he asked for a donation of 20, 50 english pounds. cheeky bugger. i gave him 50 rupees and walked off. matt gave him nothing, argued for a while until the guy gave up asking. It made me feel low for an hour or so.\nit has been an emotional rollercoaster here. lots of highs but you get one or two untrustworthy sods who make you paranoid about everyone and who make you trust no-one. which is a good instinct but makes me feel paranoid and a bit standoffish to anyone who is nice to us.\nbefore i blather on too much longer and besides the downsides of having my ankles bitten to shreds by mosquitos and stroppy cows and cowshit everywhere here are the top bits of Pushkar:\n– sunsets from the east side of the lake or a rooftop cafe\n– banana lassi\n– delicious banana pancakes @ Rising Star hotel\n– rose jam on toast @ Honey \u0026amp; Spice\n– smoothies @ Sonu juice bar on Sadar Bazaar\n– a family following us up the narrow streets by our hotel, us thinking what are they up to and the husband finally plucking up the courage to ask for a photo of us two with his wife and son\n– monkey watching – the first day we didn’t see a single one but since then we have seen hundreds! It’s funny watching them steal bananas fromm the market stalls and scamper up the electricity poles out of reach to nibble their swag. Quite a number hang around the rooftops near Rising Star, chancing a bread roll or a bottle of pop from someone’s kitchen. We watched as one nabbed a half bottle of fanta and bit the end so he could pour it across the rooftop and slurp it up. Another did it with some pepsi. They love their sugary drinks as much as the indian people!\nWe saw a couple of mother macaques with their babies hanging on tightly as they bounced from roof to roof.

There is no u-bend on the sink. The pipe goes from the plug-hole onto the floor to flow across to the drain.\nThe toilet only flushes once you turn a tap to fill up the cistern.\nAnd there is a huge speaker on a plastic chair on the balcony.\nThe rooftop “restaurant” has amazing views on 3 sides of the lake and at sunnset we sat drinking cinnamon black tea and banana lassi (4 out of 5) listening to the drums and the chants of the pilgrims as they walked towards the ghats in their brightly coloured saris.\nAt sunset they bathed in the water and left very quickly. The multi-coloured lights came on around town including the red fairy lights in the Sanjay rooftop restaurant together with the Hindi music.\nAnd as Matt and I sat there eating veg thali and listening to Amazing Grace in Hindi remix together with “Hare Krishna” chants, we felt so chilled out.

It was surreal. Like a painting superimposed on the landscape.\nWe both wondered how something so beautiful and perfect could be surrounded by such poverty.\nthe early shift paid off as there wasn’t the crowds at that time as we saw later that day.\nwe treated ourselves to a rooftop breakfast at Gulshan Restaurant, another LP recommendation just near South Gate where we could see the top of the Taj not too far beyond the crumbling rooftops of the restaurants and shops and the monkeys and the pigeons.\n(we had just seen one monkey shoot across the road after being caught stealing from a shop – those guys can move fast!)\n15 rupees for a large shot of yummy sweet milky coffee, toast and banana.

Many men were there and no women so we left quickly.\nwe had to stop again as a procession of men, maybe 100 or more, walked past, some carrying a wooden stretcher with a colourfully wrapped body going to the ghat for the funeral,\ni definitely felt like i shouldn’t be there but it was a privilege to see.\nthe Red Fort was fantastic too (apart from almost being bribed by the guard to take our laptop in) we spent hours people and monkey watching\na sunset trip to the Mehtab Bagh park to see the Taj Mahal from the north side of the river\nour tuk-tuk was stopped by guards at a bridge on the way and our driver said something about $10 but he managed to blag it so we could cross without paying (apparently that happens a lot to tourists and matt’s white legs may have been our giveaway :) )\nthrough a poor area of Agra to the edge of the river, again more guards sat to our side made it an uneasy mood. but the view was again amazing and as it rained a little a rainbow to the left of the Taj really topped it off.\nour driver prompted us to leave before complete sunset. i think he was worried aboutthe tax on the way back. so i covered my arms and we sat back in the tuk tuk to make us less conspicuous which seemed to work.\nback at TRH we bumped into James from Nirvana Hostel and shared some veg curry whilst chatting about our next plans and getting the giggles when the guy came to take our room numbers. it all got a bit confusing when we said we were in 123 and james was in 132. the guy couldn’t deal with that.\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/travels/2010/09/20/day-5-saturday-18th-september-2010-agra-taj-mahal-red-fort/","summary":"6am outside Tourists Rest House, no sign of our lift.

If I had realised I would probably have prepared a little better. Two days ago I ran my first Kymin Dash, a ~7 mile run but includes a decent hill. Four days ago I ran in a 10km race between local clubs and broke 40 minutes for the first time.\nUnsurprisingly, I didn’t have the highest hopes before tonights race, my legs were tight and still a bit sore.

Start the watch and run!\nMaybe it was being caught off-guard, but I shot off without any time to get nervous and build thoughts of self-doubt. I reached the half-way point, and glanced at my watch. I was on target. I was better than on target, I was going too fast. It didn’t matter though, I felt good. I dug in for the return to the finished line. Although the course is a simple 2.5km out, then 2.5km back, I’m pretty sure that the return leg is longer 😉\nI can see the finish in the distance now, another look at my watch, 17 minutes. 2 minutes left if I’m to hit my target. The finish looks far away and although I’m running as fast as I can, I know I’ve slowed down. I pick out a road sign ahead that I think is half way between me and the end. I tell myself, “If I can reach that in 1 minute, then I can do it”. 1 minute and 15 seconds later I run past the sign. Damn. “Forget that, it probably wasn’t half way”, my legs are burning, “it’s only another 45 seconds, just sprint like mad!” I fly over the finish line and tap my watch. It takes me a second or two before I’m physically able to look at the watch because my arms are still flailing around trying to slow down. 18:58. Whoop! I punch the air like I’ve just won the thing as other runners who finished earlier clap slowly and politely.\nSo, I hit my target with 2 seconds to spare. Well done me. That’s that then.

Although I wasn’t fully aware of it at the time, I was getting inspired. Not only was I getting inspired to take more picutres, I was getting inspired to focus on stepping out of my comfort zone and going after my dreams.\nLou talked about recently teaching his nephew how to ask a girl out. His advice was simple: “Just ask her”. His nephew replied, “But then what would I say?”. “Woah!, that’s phase 2, don’t worry about that. Focus on phase 1: Asking her”.\nThe analogy was straight forward enough and was advice for us as photographers if we want to take pictures of the strangers we meet in the street. The worst that can happen is they can say no.\nI took my camera to work today determined I would simply take pictures of all the interesting people I met. Throughout the day I saw several ideal candidates. But I can’t ask her, she has headphones on. She’s walking too fast, must be in a rush. The light’s not right. He doesn’t look friendly. She’s too tall, I’d have to climb something to get the right angle, but she’ll think I’m just trying to take a picture of her boobs… My brain found an excuse in an instant for all of them. The truth was that I was a big scared wimp.\nI went out again, on my own this evening to walk around the harbour specifically to see if I could pluck up the courage to ask someone if I could take their portrait. All too soon, my opportunities were missed and the sun had set so I headed home dragging my heels. On the way however I saw a girl with an amazing look and I went for it so spontaneously that I surprised myself.\n “Hi!”\n She looks startled. I mean, very startled. It’s quite late and there are only one or two other people around. I panic a little and start to blurt out my words at record pace (the opposite of Lou’s advice):\n “Erm, I know this is a bit random, but you have a really pretty and interesting face, do you mind if take your picture?”\n She’s still startled, perhaps so much so she can’t think of a better answer:\n “Um, yeah, ok”\n What? She said yes. Christ, now I’m gonna have to take this thing, where’s the light? It’s about 9:45pm and getting dark. I don’t want to use flash. I slap the camera on aperture priority to f/1.8 and cross my fingers.\n-Click-\nBlurry, damn.\nI glance up and can see she wants to leave. She heard a click and I only asked for a photo. I can’t remember what I then said, some mumbling nonsense about grain and ISO settings probably. I quickly knock the ISO up to 800.\n-Click-\nI eyeball the screen, blurry? Probably. Good enough? Yes!\n “Thanks so much for letting me take them. I can see I’m freaking you out a bit so I’m just gonna go the long way home over this way so you don’t think I’m following you. Er.. thanks again.”\n I start to scuttle off, feeling awful for scaring the poor girl then hear a feint “Cheers”. Maybe she’s just a little shocked, but flattered. I wanted to give her my card so she could at least choose to email me if she wanted to see the photos but I forgot. I didn’t even tell her my name, or ask her hers. The whole thing was a nightmare display of clumsy social awkwardness that would make any observer cringe. Did I step out of my comfort zone? Yes. Did I learn about 50 things in as many seconds? Yes.

What you really want is for them to describe the problems they are having that need to be solved. That way you might be able to design a better (simpler) solution. I’m sure it applies to every discipline, but a simple method for finding out the root problem is to just ask Why? a lot.\nThe trouble is, I get asked this question quite a lot and asking Why? to everyone multiple times takes too long so I’m just going to ask them all here as a default response to future question askers…\n Are you actually interested in photography? If you are and you’re willing to learn how to use it properly, getting an SLR is a great idea. If your rationale is that you think it’ll just take better pictures on “auto” then I’m afraid it doesn’t. You really have to learn how to use an SLR before it’ll start giving you better pictures. Most SLRs don’t shoot video (although they are starting to). Is this important? What do you want to do that a compact camera does not do? Do you want an SLR because you want a special camera for taking high quality photos? Would you use it as your only camera? Would you be happy carrying a big lump of camera everywhere you currently take a compact? In reality, you may end up taking fewer pictures than if you just took a quick compact everywhere. Is this acceptable?  Here are some tips should you just want to go ahead and buy one…\n I’d say choice is between Canon and Nikon (some argue Sony but I wouldn’t). Lenses and flashes etc. are not interchangeable between brands, so whichever one you pick, you’re kinda stuck with forever. (I’m on team Canon). Good lenses are quite pricey. You can just get the body with a kit lens (probably about ~18-55mm range) and that’ll be fine for most situations. “Kit lens” basically means a cheap entry-level lens but you get a lot of bang-for-buck. Consider buying second-hand. My first SLR (Canon 400D) is now half the price I paid for it 3 years ago. I’m not sure if that’s the average rate of camera depreciation (I couldn’t find any stats, can anyone else?) but it still takes good photos. If buying new, don’t listen to sales guy that says you need a UV filter to protect the lens or some special insurance policy. Save your money, you should just be careful with it. Ignore features like megapixels / max ISO / shutter rate etc. when comparing. This is just a sale arms race and they’re all more than good enough. Go in a shop, pick one up. More important features are: Does it feel comfy in your hand? Do you like the screen size/res/contrast? Does it focus quickly \u0026amp; quietly between dark objects in foreground \u0026amp; background? Is it too heavy/light? Stating the obvious, but read some reviews online. I buy all my stuff in Bristol Cameras on the top of corn street. Decent prices and it’s nice to be able to take something back rather than post (not needed to yet, touch wood).  If you pick a camera or get stuck between the final two choices, please ask me again…\n","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/blog/2010/05/22/buying-your-first-slr/","summary":"I get asked the following question quite a lot:\n I want to buy an SLR, what one shall I get?\n In my software engineering life, clients often approach me with a description of software they want me to write.

I paid my £20 in support of the scheme even though there were no bike stations in the places I needed them. I feel if there were more bikes and more stations it would have been ideal. (see my comment from back then…).\nUnfortunately, they’ve decided to end the scheme deeming it unsuccessful:\n Dear Hourbike Member,\nIt is with regret that I have to report that the bike sharing\npilot project that we started in partnership with Bristol City\nCouncil, The University of the West of England and First Great\nWestern Trains is coming to a close. The intention of the current\npilot was to test the acceptance of the concept and determine the\npotential demand for such a scheme with the hope of expanding it\nbeyond a pilot. Feedback from yourselves and from enquiries has\nclearly shown that there is an interest in this type of scheme\nbut the Cycling City project has determined that it has more\npressing priorities and therefore cannot commit further funding at\nthis point in time.\nThe support of Bristol City Council both in terms of finance but\nalso the credibility of the scheme is particularly important, and\nthough other funding was received from the other founding partners\n– First Great Western and the University of West of England – the\nsignificant majority of funding has come from private investment.\nWithout the support of the local authority the scheme is unable\nto attract further private investment.\nMy apologies to any of you that have noticed the recent reduction\nin the availability of bikes at the stands.

I’ve not developed with OpenJDK and so blamed that at first, it couldn’t possibly be Maven… So, I downloaded the Sun JDK, and as you can guess, I realised it was a Maven thing.\nWhen you create a simple Maven project using the m2eclipse eclipse plugin it defaults to a Java 1.4 compliance level.

Right?\nI’m sure I’m not alone in finding the process of buying anything a little tedious now:\n See something in the shop you like Decide not to buy it because you don’t know if that’s a good price You get home and look on the internet Now you have to poke around a few websites and try to work out which is cheapest when you consider postage and tax etc. Maybe one of the sites gives you rebate if you go through a referal like quidco Maybe the site would give a discount if only you had a voucher code  If you ask me, It’s all a pain in the ass.\nMy brother emailed me yesterday:\n Anyway you can crack into this site to find some good discount codes? http://www.designersunglasses.co.uk\nBR20 for 20% as expired.\n I recognised this. He’s at stage 6 I thought (or at least I would have done if I’d numbered the stages in my head like I have above). He’s googled for a code but only found one that’s out of date.\nI started to pen my reply:\n I know I work with computers but there’s no way I can find out what the codes are, they’ll all be validated server-side when you try a code…\n Then it hit me. Why not just brute force the code? Worth a shot right?\nI cobbled together a littler bit of java to try various combinations of 2 characters followed by 2 digits based on the fact that the expired code was BR20 for 20%. The code below uses JWebUnit which is simply a convenience wrapper for HtmlUnit.\nLong story short, it found several codes! One of which was for quite a substantial discount. I’m not going to post the codes (don’t bother asking). If you want a code, you’re welcome to run the sourcecode below or write your own. If the voucher code gets posted on the internet, it’ll probably get disabled pretty quickly too.\nHas anyone else written similar things? I’m curious to what other approaches people may have taken. I also think it wouldn’t be too hard to make this a generic application that rattles through all possible codes for a user-supplied regex.\nMy advise to web developers for anything like this would be to introduce a delay after a few invalid guesses and then start doubling the length of the delay with each invalid guess. This would quickly make any brute force technique pretty useless.\n[code lang=\u0026quot;java\u0026quot;] import net.sourceforge.jwebunit.junit.WebTestCase; public class CodeFinderTest extends WebTestCase { public void setUp() throws Exception { super.setUp(); setBaseUrl(\u0026quot;http://www.designersunglasses.co.uk\u0026quot;); } public void test1() { beginAt(\u0026quot;/mens_sunglasses/d_g_dd3011-c96785p138605.html\u0026quot;); submit(); for (int perc = 20; perc \u0026lt;= 100; perc += 5) { for (char firstLetter = 'A'; firstLetter \u0026lt;= 'Z'; firstLetter++) { System.out.println(); for (char secondLetter = 'A'; secondLetter \u0026lt;= 'Z'; secondLetter++) { // generate the next code to try String code = Character.toString(firstLetter) + Character.toString(secondLetter) + perc; System.out.print(code + \u0026quot;,\u0026quot;); // basket_campaign_code is the html id of the text field setTextField(\u0026quot;basket_campaign_code\u0026quot;, code); submit(); // if the response didn't say \u0026quot;invalid code\u0026quot; then it must have said something else... if (!getPageSource().contains( \u0026quot;You have entered an invalid code\u0026quot;)) { System.out.print(\u0026quot;\\nWAHOO!: \u0026quot; + code); // lets get greedy and bump up the percentage discount... firstLetter = secondLetter = 'Z'; break; } } } } } } [/code] ","permalink":"https://mattburns.co.uk/blog/2009/01/22/voucher-codes-and-promo-wotsits/","summary":"It’s 2009!

Great.\nHowever, I soon realised that the volume up key doesn’t work, only down works. This was a little unfortunate since it is the only key capable of turning the volume up of music when played with the music player software installed on the device. Something I definitely needed to do once I had managed to turn the volume down to zero percent.\nMy first idea was to look for some other software I could install that would allow me to alter the volume with another key but I had no luck on that front (let me know if you have).\nI then googled around and realised I was not alone and that other people had found success in taking the back off and re-soldering it, so I thought I’d have a bash.\nI ended up fixing mine with no tools, just a bit of paper.\nHere’s how to take the back off:\n Turn it off. Take the battery out Slide phone open and bend one side off Bend the rest off. I was quite rough with mine and I’ve done it a few times now and it has been fine.  You should see the two microswitches, the volume up microswitch on mine was bent upwards. Not only does this mean it doesn’t connect the circuit, but it also won’t be pressed by the outer button.\nI simply jammed a bit of paper in there to make the microswitch touch the contacts again.\nIf this post has helped you fix your phone, show me some love with the flattr link above.
