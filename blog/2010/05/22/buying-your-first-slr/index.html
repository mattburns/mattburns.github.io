Do you want an SLR because you want a special camera for taking high quality photos? Would you use it as your only camera?

Consider buying second-hand. My first SLR (Canon 400D) is now half the price I paid for it 3 years ago. I’m not sure if that’s the average rate of camera depreciation (I couldn’t find any stats, can anyone else?) but it still takes good photos.

More important features are: Does it feel comfy in your hand? Do you like the screen size/res/contrast? Does it focus quickly \u0026 quietly between dark objects in foreground \u0026 background? Is it too heavy/light? Stating the obvious, but read some reviews online. I buy all my stuff in Bristol Cameras on the top of corn street. Decent prices and it’s nice to be able to take something back rather than post (not needed to yet, touch wood).
