      <description>I’ve long been sold on the concept of Convention Over Configuration. For me it’s a no-brainer, not only am I lazy, but when I am forced to make a decision about something technical, well, let’s just say the number of times I get it wrong is &amp;gt; 0.
Recently I’ve been playing around with Maven, something I should have done years ago. Maven seems pretty sold on the convention idea too and so I just expected a simple project to work “out of the box”.</description>

      <description>It’s 2009! Our digital lives are a breeze and online shopping is just one more option to the newly empowered consumer. Right?
I’m sure I’m not alone in finding the process of buying anything a little tedious now:
 See something in the shop you like Decide not to buy it because you don’t know if that’s a good price You get home and look on the internet Now you have to poke around a few websites and try to work out which is cheapest when you consider postage and tax etc.</description>
