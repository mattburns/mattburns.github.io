      <description>It’s 2009! Our digital lives are a breeze and online shopping is just one more option to the newly empowered consumer. Right?
I’m sure I’m not alone in finding the process of buying anything a little tedious now:
 See something in the shop you like Decide not to buy it because you don’t know if that’s a good price You get home and look on the internet Now you have to poke around a few websites and try to work out which is cheapest when you consider postage and tax etc.</description>
