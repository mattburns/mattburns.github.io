      <description>I recently got my hands on a nokia N95. Great.
However, I soon realised that the volume up key doesnâ€™t work, only down works. This was a little unfortunate since it is the only key capable of turning the volume up of music when played with the music player software installed on the device. Something I definitely needed to do once I had managed to turn the volume down to zero percent.</description>
