      <description>Do you get an error when you try to install Flex Builder? Ignore it and carry on anyway.
Edit the file:
[eclipse]\links\com.adobe.flexbuilder.feature.core.link
and just stick “path=” at the start so it looks something like this:
path=C:/Program Files/Adobe/Flex Builder 3 Plug-in
Thanks to greylurk for the original tip.</description>

      <title>Convention ÷ Configuration</title>

      <description>I’ve long been sold on the concept of Convention Over Configuration. For me it’s a no-brainer, not only am I lazy, but when I am forced to make a decision about something technical, well, let’s just say the number of times I get it wrong is &amp;gt; 0.
Recently I’ve been playing around with Maven, something I should have done years ago. Maven seems pretty sold on the convention idea too and so I just expected a simple project to work “out of the box”.</description>
