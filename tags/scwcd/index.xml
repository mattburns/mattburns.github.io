      <description>As I previously metioned, I’m taking the SCWCD exam tomorrow. When trying to cram for any exam I like to make up short poems, acronyms or just random chains of though. For example, I know the difference between Mitosis and Meiosis because Meiosis begins with “Meow” which is what cats do and they have four legs… anyway…
My first thing to remember is that a JspContext has a findAttribute method that I can use to Pick the Right Scope Automatically.</description>

      <description>I’m sitting another Sun* Certification exam tomorrow to become a Sun Certified Web Component Developer (SCWCD). I’ve done a bit of revising but I’m writing this post mainly as a way to procrastinate. I should take more exams really if only as a way to get other things done. Procrastination during my final year of uni enabled me to learn how to speedsolve a Rubik’s Cube.
I’ve just read the study guide for the SCWCD exam; Head First Servlets and JSP.</description>
